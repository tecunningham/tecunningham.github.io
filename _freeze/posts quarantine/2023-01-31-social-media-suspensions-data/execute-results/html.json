The chart below summarizes the full dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_cfd31c44aaedec9ef1a202f494e0608c'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=720}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**The data helps illuminate what platforms are doing.** It is very difficult for an outside observer to see how a platform moderates their content. The advantages of studying the suspension of prominent users are that (1) the data is public and (2) the outcomes are comparable across platforms.\n\n**Key findings.**\n\n1. **The rate of suspensions has grown over time.** The increase seems to be primarily due to a progressive adoption of new policies rather than changes in user behaviour or changes in enforcement.\n\n2. **Suspension practices are fairly similar across the major platforms.** Meta, Twitter, and YouTube all have broadly similar policies: they each suspend users for hate speech, election misinformation, COVID misinformation, and incitement.\n\n3. **The most common reasons for suspension were hate speech (15%) and COVID misinformation (12%).** Platforms typically do not publicly state the reason why they suspend an account, however I was able to code the majority of cases either because the reason was clear from context, or was reported by the user, or because the reason was given by the platform to a journalist. In 19% of cases I could find no reason given. For cases with a reason there were quite a wide variety, the top reasons were hate speech (15%), covid misinfo (12%), incitement (7%), and personal information (6%).\n\n4. **Twitter suspended more people than other platforms.** From examining cases it seems this was primarily due to differences in the type of content that is posted on Twitter compared to other platforms, rather than differences in policies or  differences in enforcement.\n\n5. **US politicians were suspended at a much higher rate than non-US politicians.** This seems to be a mixture of US politicians being more active on Twitter, being more likely to make policy-violating statements, and being under more scrutinty from Twitter.\n\n6. **Among US Federal politicians suspended, 8 were Republicans, none were Democrats.** The Republicans were suspended for a variety of different reasons and on a variety of platforms. The asymmetry does not seem to be primarily a difference in enforcement, but a higher propensity for Republicans to say or do policy-violating things.\n\n<!-- **I would really appreciate comments.** I'm sure I'm missing important data, and I'm sure I have some mistakes. Comment permissions are open to all for the spreadsheet, in an Appendix below I describe the criteria used for filling in the data. I would also be very happy to find collaborators, and perhaps partner with an institution who could maintain this database going forward. -->\n\n**I am working on a separate essay about *why* platforms suspend users.** It is difficult to give clear reasons *why* platforms suspend users. In a separate essay I try to break down how much their action can be attributed to influence from owners, from employees, from users, from advertisers, or from governments. Having this dataset of suspensions is very useful to be able to make generalizations about platform behavior.\n\n\n#           Dataset\n\n**The figure below shows the entire dataset.** Each line represents a suspension, with a given start and end date, colored according to the platform that implemented the suspension. I have highlighted the earliest suspension I observe: Courtney's Love suspension from Twitter in 2011 for defamation. I have also highlighted all the suspensions of Donald Trump: in 2017 a rogue employee suspended him from Twitter, in January 2021 he was suspended from multiple platforms. Twitter and Meta both gave him temporary suspensions, then a number of platforms gave him indefinite suspensions. Twitter, Meta and YouTube all lifted their Trump suspensions in late 2022 or early 2023.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_2d70775b84c329e29d4c56424a4dae31'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=720}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**I am including only *newsworthy* suspensions.** My basic criterion is to include any suspension which merits a mainstream news story. My process of collection has been collecting whatever caught my attention and supplementing that with data from Wikipedia, Ballotpedia, and Google searches (see [Appendix](#appendix-data-sources) for more discussion of sources). I believe that the data probably covers the majority of the newsworthy suspensions in the US since 2016, however for suspensions outside the US the fraction is surely lower. There is more detail on data sources in an [Appendix](#appendix-codebook). I have a list of other datasources for suspensions at the bottom of this document. Particular blind spots are (1) countries outside the US; (2) platforms like Twitch; (3) celebrities, especially adult performers who have high rates of being suspended, and who often have many followers.\n\n<!-- 2. **Add more fields.** It would also be useful to add a best-guess at follower-count at the time of suspension when possible, I might be able to get this data from SocialBlade or archive.org. -->\n\n**I have a rough database of platform policy changes.** In an [Appendix](#appendix-history-of-policy-changes) I have a rough history of platform policy changes, and references to other similar databases online. One thing that I hope to work on as followup is a database of policies that would allow apples-to-apples compare what content is banned across platforms and across time. I also include in the Appendix a table showing general trends of famous people being excluded from mainstream media (film, television, music).\n\n#           Aggregate Patterns\n\n**The rate of suspensions has substantially increased over time.** The data show a substantial increase in suspensions, from an average of 1-2 per year before mid-2017, to an average of 10-20 per year since then. The observed increase is probably partly due to growth in overall activity on the platforms and partly due to my observations being biased towards more-recent suspensions, but I think the primary cause is an expansion of the rules which would justify a ban, discussed further below.\n\n<!-- TODO: add 12-month moving average -->\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_8b5d72c69d8dedcf21564ae2ff8c03eb'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=720}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**There are three prominent peaks in the history of suspensions:**\n\n- **June 2020:** a variety of American and British political personalities on the right were suspended for hate speech or similar reasons by Twitter and YouTube. On Twitter: Katie Hopkins, David Duke, American Renaissance (Jared Taylor). On YouTube: Stefan Molyneux, Gavin McInnes, American Renaissance (Jared Taylor), Richard Spencer, National Policy Institute. \n- **January 2021:** many US politicians and political commentators were suspended after the capitol riot.\n- **November-December 2022:** Twitter suspended many prominent figures for a variety of reasons under new policies introduced by Elon Musk.\n\n**The most suspensions are from Twitter, then Meta, then YouTube.** We can see that Twitter suspension have been growing continuously since 2015, with a spike in 2021 due to the Capitol riot. Meta and YouTube also show an increase since 2017, but less-clear pattern of continuous growth.\n\nIn the Appendix I compare data from [Twitter's transparency reports](#twitter-1) which report *total* account suspensions on Twitter (i.e. suspensions of all accounts, not just prominent accounts) between 2018 and 2021. That data shows slower growth: suspensions for abuse grew by a factor of around 2, and suspensions for hateful conduct grew from 2018 to 2019 then decreased.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_d8a14b6f7334069b8971d6412af5959a'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=720}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Suspension policies have become stricter.** Several new policies have been added by platforms over the last 10 years which have tightened the limits on acceptable speech. Some examples (see [Appendix](#appendix-history-of-policy-changes) for more details). Note that policies usually describe the type of content that will be removed, violations are only sometimes punished with an account suspension, and often platforms have a \"strike\" system for account suspension.\n\n1. Misgendering/deadnaming: Twitter (2018), TikTok (2022).\n2. Group superiority/inferiority: Meta (2019), YouTube (2019).\n3. Holocaust denial: YouTube (2019), Twitter (2020), Meta (2020), Reddit (2020).\n4. Harmful medical misinformation: Meta (2020), YouTube (2021).\n5. False allegations of election fraud: Meta (2021), YouTube (2021).\n\nBroadly speaking it appears that the growth in suspension is attributable more to a change in policies than due to a change in behaviour or due to a change in application of policies. This is because it appears that a majority of suspensions over the last 5 years were taken under policies that did not exist prior to 2018.\n\nTwo important policies were introduced in response to external events: COVID misinformation and election deligitimization. Many accounts have been suspended under these new policies since 2020 but it is difficult to say whether this reflects a generally increased strictness of platforms.\n\n**Suspension policies have rarely been relaxed.** There are two substantial instances of relaxation of moderation policy I'm aware of:\n\n1. A \"newsworthiness\" exemption for bans, i.e. effectively a relaxation of those bans. Newsworthiness exemption were officially introduced by Meta in 2016, Twitter in 2017, and Youtube in 2019.\n2. Twitter's relaxation of policies under Elon Musk in late-2022. Twitter unsuspended many prominent accounts, however they also suspended many accounts for new reasons, and there has been little official communication of new policies.\n\n**Reasons for suspension.**  Platforms typically do not publicly state the reason why they suspend an account, however I was able to code the majority of cases either because the reason was clear from context, or was reported by the user, or because the reason was given by the platform to a journalist. In 19% of cases I could find no reason given. For cases with a reason there were quite a wide variety:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_ff7a82dba2e985426d66949f5f51e112'}\n:::

that Meta, Twitter, and YouTube all have broadly similar policies: they will suspend users for all of the following reasons:\n\n\n::: {.cell

This policy is notably stronger than Meta or YouTube.] \n\n\n\n#           By Type of Target\n\n##          Politicians\n\n**Among US Federal politicians only Republicans have been suspended.** In the US 8 Republicans have had one or more suspension, but no Democrats. Among the Republicans the suspensions were for a variety of reasons: related to the Jan 6 riots (Trump, Barry Moore, MTG), related to COVID (Ron Johnson, Rand Paul, MTG), for misgendering (Jim Banks), for tweeting a threat (Briscoe Cain), for animal blood on a profile photo (Steve Daines), one by a rogue employee (Trump).\n\nIt seems to me that the asymmetry in suspensions is primarily due to Republicans being more likely to violate the policies, rather than asymmetric enforcement of existing policies. I am not aware of any cases where a Democratic politician violated one of these policies but was not suspended.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_4b39fa579b0014b4e13751b72a03cb72'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=720}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Suspension of national politicians outside the US has been relatively rare.** My dataset contains 13 national politicians who were suspended in the world outside the US, compared to 8 in the US. This is a big asymmetry, and something of a puzzle. I have discussed this with a number of people who worked in enforcement and they attribute to a mixture of (1) less policy-violating behaviour from non-US politicians; (2) looser enforcement against non-US politicians; (3) lower overall social media usage outside the US; and (4) lower coverage of non-US politicians in my dataset.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_82e4c14aec1e2b6dc315106cff761eb1'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=720}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##          US Prominent Figures\n\nThis shows all suspensions of US \"notable people\":\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-10_540d531ff21c87552c7eff94546ac03d'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=720}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Between 2015 and 2017 there were a series of alt-right personalities suspended from Twitter.** The suspensions were often not for their views but their behaviour: \n\n- 2015: Charles Johnson from Twitter for a threat.\n- 2016: Milo Yiannopoulos from Twitter for harassment, Richard Spencer from Twitter for manipulation.\n- 2017: Roger Stone from Twitter for abuse.\n- 2018: Alex Jones from Twitter for incitement and abuse.\n\n**Beginning in late 2017 more alt-right accounts were suspended.** Either for hate speech, for offline behaviour, or without any public reason given: \n\n- Late 2017: Baked Alaska from Twitter for hate speech.\n- 2018: Owen Benjamin from Twit with no reason given, Alex Jones from FB and YouTube for hate speech.\n- 2019: Nick Fuentes from Meta with no reason given.\n\n**Between November 2020 and January 2021 a large set of prominent figures were suspended for election-related reasons.** The most suspensions were on Twitter but there were also from other platforms.\n\n1.

In the future it would be nice to also include any suspensions of accounts with more than a certain number of followers.\n\n**Definition of a suspension.** It is a suspension if any of the following are true:\n\n- Your existing content is available but you cannot post new content.\n- Users cannot see your existing content anywhere on the site.\n- Users cannot post links to your domain (e.g. cannot link to `piratebay.se`).\n- Users cannot search for your hashtag (this applies to social movements, e.g. `#StopTheSteal`).\n- Your content is blocked in the region where the majority of your followers are.\n\nOn Twitter users often can end their suspension by deleting a specific tweet, I count these as suspensions. The following do not count as suspensions:\n\n- Your content is demonetized but still visible.\n- Your content is removed from some surfaces but still available on your profile.\n- Your content is blocked in a region where a minority of your followers are.\n- Your content is blocked only for a secondary type of sharing (e.g. when Instagram [disabled](https://www.thethings.com/why-madonna-banned-from-instagram-live-controversial-photos/) Madonna's ability to stream to Instagram Live, but not to post regular photos; e.g. in 2010 50 cent was [suspended from Twitpic](https://metro.co.uk/2010/08/30/50-cent-in-twitter-war-after-x-rated-photos-see-him-banned-3436802/) but not Twitter).\n\n**Coding of platform.** I categorize a suspension from either FB or Instagram as a suspension from \"Meta\". There are some cases where a person has been suspended from one but not the other, in those cases I leave an annotation in the spreadsheet.\n\n**Coding of reason for suspension.** Most platforms do not give public statements on the reason for a suspension, however it appears that they commonly give information to journalists which is then reflected in news stories. When there is some quotation I include it in the \"long reason.\" The reasons are as stated by platform, I am obviously not endorsing their judgments of whether they are making correct determinations of whether the policy applies, or if the stated reason is the true reason. I have tried to compress the \"short\" reasons into a small number of distinct reasons using my judgment. In some cases there is no company statement but the reason is obvious (e.g. I coded Kanye West's \"I'm going death con 3 on jewish people\" statement as \"hate speech\").\n\n**We record suspensions of *entities* not *accounts*.** I try to record the suspension of the *person* or *group* rather than the account. E.g. Courtney Love's original Twitter account ([@CourtneyLoveUK](https://twitter.com/CourtneyLoveUK)) was suspended in 2011 and is still suspended, but Courtney Love seems to have been using another account since at least April 2012, without any suspensions for ban-evasion, and so I count the end-date as April 2012.\n\n#           Appendix: History of Policy Changes\n\n**Here we collect platform statements of policy changes.** I try to restrict to explicit statements of changes regarding what is banned or not. For each statement I give a summary, if a single statement contains multiple significant changes I list it multiple times. The list is very incomplete, I would guess it currently contains only around 1/2 of the relevant policy changes from the large platforms. Additionally there are probably many significant policy changes that are never explicitly announced.\n\n- **Meta.**\n   - 2013-05-01: [ban graphic violence (beheading)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/23/facebook-removes-beheading-video)\n   - 2013-10-23: [ban graphic violence (beheading) (again)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/23/facebook-removes-beheading-video): *\"Facebook had introduced a temporary ban on such videos in May but later decided to remove the block on the grounds that the site is used to share information about world events.\"* Then ban was reintroduced after outcry.\n   - 2014-06-13: [exemption for nipples if breastfeeding](https://time.com/2869849/facebook-breastfeeding-nipples/)\n   - 2015-12-01: [exemption for newsworthy (not announced, applied to Trump video)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/28/facebook-zuckerberg-trump-hate/)\n   - 2016-09-01: [exemption for nudity if historically important (\"terror of war\"/napalm girl)](https://www.facebook.com/josofsky/posts/10157347245570231)\n   - 2016-10-21: [exemption for newsworthy (publicly announced)](https://about.fb.com/news/2016/10/input-from-community-and-partners-on-our-community-standards/)\n   - 2019-03-27: [ban on white separatism](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/standing-against-hate/) *\"praise, support and representation of white nationalism and white separatism\"*\n   - 2019-09-24: [exemption for speech from politicians](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/elections-and-political-speech/), *\"we will treat speech from politicians as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard.\"*\n   - 2019-12-19: [ban on \"denying existence\" of someone's gender identity](https://reclaimthenet.org/facebook-bans-denying-existence-gender-identity).

I have not taken the time to include references. In some cases there are conflicting claims about whether there was an exclusion, I generally take the person's own judgment at face value.\n\n**More important than exclusions of individuals were exclusions of entire classes.** For much of the 20th century african americans, asians, women, & openly gay people, had a pronounced difficulty getting roles in entertainment. This would be useful to document quantitatively but I think it would be more work.^[There's a nice visualization [here](https://www.scmp.com/infographics/article/1917641/infographic-what-color-oscar) showing the history of oscar nominations: between 1927 and 1948 there were approximately 400 nominations for best actor or director, the only black nominee was Hattie McDaniel in 1939 for best supporting actress in Gone with the Wind.]\n\n**There are three basic reasons for exclusion: politics, art, or personal life.**\n\n**Exclusion of people for their politics.** By far the biggest exclusion was the anti-communist blacklisting of the 1940s and 1950s. Many of the most prominent people in Hollywood were out of work for a decade or more, often based on fairly weak evidence of communist associations.\n\nDuring wars celebrities have sometimes been excluded for being disloyal: during the Vietnam war (Jane Fonda, John Lennon, Eartha Kitt), and during the Iraq War (Sean Penn, Dixie Chicks).\n\nIn the last 20 years a number of people have been excluded for anti-homosexual statements (Isaiah Washington, Kirk Cameron) or generally conservative statements (Gina Carano, James Woods, Stacy Dash).\n\n**Exclusion of people for their art.** These seem relatively rare. During the 1970s-1990s a few musicians were excluded for shocking or transgressive art, e.g. the Sex Pistols, Marilyn Manson, Body Count. Kathy Griffin has had a couple of episodes of exclusion for different statements intended to shock. In the 1980s and 1990s a number of radio hosts said shocking things and were fined or fired (e.g. Howard Stern).\n\n**Exclusion of people for their personal life:**  Exclusions prior to the mid-2000s were mostly for more severe accusations (Roman Polanski, Woody Allen, OJ Simpson, Mel Gibson), and the exclusions were sometimes relatively mild. In the last 20 years these exclusions have become much more common, especially for sex-related accusations against men.\n\n**Exclusion for other reasons.** (1) some have been boycotted by their peers for informing on fellow artists (Eliza Kazan, Lovin Spoonful); (2) the police have temporarily boycotted a number of musicians for songs criticizing the police (NWA, Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce).\n\n\n\n##             Exclusions in Film and Television\n\n|       |                     | alleged crime                      | result                                         |\n| ----- |
