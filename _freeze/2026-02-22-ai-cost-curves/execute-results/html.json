In most cases agents are cheaper than humans but hit a ceiling in capability.\n2. Can simplify to say agents are free, without much loss.\n3. We can see three types of agent growth: (A) cheaper inference; (B) expanded capabilities; (C) test-time growth. \n4. Distillation shifts cost curves left.\n5. This observation is a nice fit for time horizon (more discussion required)\n6. Q: can you derive these curves from a theory of task complexity?\n\nBasic plot:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2026-02-22-ai-cost-curves_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThree types of agent change:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2026-02-22-ai-cost-curves_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#               additional plots\n\nExtra plots:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2026-02-22-ai-cost-curves_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
