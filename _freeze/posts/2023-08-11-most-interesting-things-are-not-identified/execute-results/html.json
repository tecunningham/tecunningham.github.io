And in the majority of cases we don't have an experiment or natural experiment we can use to get a clean estimate of $\\Theta$.\n\nIn government policy decision-making we don't have well-identified evidence on virtually any policy program. Yet we still make policy decisions, probably not terrible ones, and we've been doing it for thousands of years.\n\nIn business decision-making people have recently struck oil -- by running experiments that can identify a lot of things -- but people still made business decisions in the pre-experiment age, they probably weren't at random, and I think still the majority of big decisions at companies rely principally on understanding for which we can't get direct experimental evidence on (due to lags & network effects).\n\nPerhaps this is obvious to everyone, but it strikes me that Lewbel doesn't mention this stark fact -- i.e., that most of our understanding of the world and decision-making is based on inference *without* identification. And arguably the focus on identification has left us with less intellectual focus on inference-without-identification than we ought to have.\n\nA compromise position would be this: identification is always a tradeoff. You can always identify a parameter if you add sufficiently strong assumptions, e.g. by just assuming away all confounding. And so all inference is identification. But I think this is a stretch of the meaning of the word -- in particular, I think most of the actual inference going on in policy & business decision-making is best described as approximately Bayesian, where no value of $\\Theta$ is ever ruled out, but our likelihoods over $\\Theta$ keep shifting around as new evidence comes in.\n\n(I'm not trying to criticize anyone's work on identification, either in theory of application, we've surely learned a lot from it, just remarking on what seems to be an important piece of context, that well-identified-inference is a small subset of all inference, and the non-well-identified-inference is not all bad).\n\n[FB post](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10164129099425230&id=822835229)  \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nTo add:\n\n- **To achieve identification researchers sacrifice other qualities.** They make judgment calls which affect the strength of the result.^[Sometimes called \"the garden of forking paths.\"] Papers are written in a legalistic tone, they read not as a summary of evidence but as a brief for the prosection.\n- **Bradford-hill criteria.**\n- **The alternative: shoe leather.**\n- **Awkward to pretend we don't these things.** A contradiction to other parts of economics: models in which every agent knows the entire set of causal effects.\n  - Editor will gladly publish an estimate of a causal effect $\\pm$100%, but would want very strong evidence for a paper in which it's important that people make decisions which vary from the true quantity by 20%.",
