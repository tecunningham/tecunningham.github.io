I use the Tullock contest success function to visualize this. A multiplicative efficiency boost (equivalently, a cost reduction) shifts the contest success function, rotates best-response curves, and changes equilibrium efforts in non-obvious ways. Surprisingly, improved efficiency can sometimes *reduce* your equilibrium payoff due to intensified competition.\n:::\n\nWhen AI or other technology makes one side more effective at conflict—better at finding vulnerabilities, generating content, or deploying resources—the equilibrium changes. But in which direction?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Core question: How does efficiency improvement change equilibrium?](2025-XX-XX-tullock-contests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe **Tullock contest success function** provides a tractable framework. I visualize how the function looks, how best responses behave, and how efficiency improvements shift equilibrium.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Intuition: Why This Matters\nThink of two companies competing for a government contract, or two countries in an arms race. Each side can invest resources (effort) to win. The Tullock framework models:\n1. **How effort translates to winning** ($r$ parameter)\n2. **Strategic interaction** (my optimal effort depends on yours)\n3. **Equilibrium waste** (total spending can exceed the prize value)\n4. **Technology shocks** (what happens when one side gets more efficient?)\n\nKey insight: Improving one side's efficiency doesn't just redistribute payoffs—it changes *total* resource waste.\n:::\n\n# The Contest Success Function\n\nTwo players compete for a **prize worth $V=\\$100$**. Player 1 spends $x_1$, player 2 spends $x_2$. The **Tullock contest success function** gives the probability player 1 wins:\n\n$$P_1(x_1,x_2) = \\frac{x_1^r}{x_1^r + x_2^r}$$\n\nwhere $r>0$ is the **returns to scale** parameter.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n- $r<1$: Decreasing returns. Contest is more balanced even with unequal investments.\n- $r=1$: Linear returns. Probability equals your share of total effort.\n- $r>1$: Increasing returns. Contest favors whoever invests more (winner-take-all).\n\n## Contest Equilibria Across Parameter Values\n\nBelow we show equilibrium expenditures for different contest parameters. In all cases: **Prize $V=\\$100$**, symmetric costs $c_1=c_2=1$. The black dot shows the Nash equilibrium.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Contest equilibria with varying returns to scale (V=$100, c₁=c₂=1)](2025-XX-XX-tullock-contests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key patterns across r values:**\n\n1. **As $r$ increases**, equilibrium efforts increase:\n   - $r=0.5$: Each spends \\$12.50 (25% dissipation)\n   - $r=1$: Each spends \\$25 (50% dissipation)\n   - $r=1.5$: Each spends \\$37.50 (75% dissipation)\n   - $r=2$: Each spends \\$50 (100% dissipation)\n\n2. **Higher $r$ means more waste**: At $r=2$, the entire \\$100 prize is dissipated through competition!\n\n3. **Contour curvature**: Higher $r$ makes the 50-50 line straighter—small leads are harder to overcome.\n\n## Asymmetric Costs: How Cost Advantages Shift Equilibria\n\nWhen one player has a cost advantage, equilibrium expenditures become asymmetric. Below: Player 1 has varying cost levels while Player 2 has $c_2=1$. Prize remains $V=\\$100$, $r=1$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Equilibria with asymmetric costs (V=$100, r=1, varying c₁/c₂)](2025-XX-XX-tullock-contests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key insights:**\n\n- **Cost advantage → more spending**: Lower-cost player spends more in absolute dollars\n- **But wins more than proportionally**: At $c_1=0.5$, Player 1 spends \\$44.44 vs Player 2's \\$22.22 (2:1 ratio), but wins with probability $P_1 = 2/3$\n- **Total dissipation varies**: Falls when costs are asymmetric (\\$66.67 vs \\$50 in symmetric case)\n\n# Best Response Functions\n\nPlayers choose effort to maximize expected payoff minus cost. Let $c_1, c_2$ be marginal costs.\n\nPlayer 1 maximizes:\n$$\\pi_1(x_1, x_2) = V \\cdot P_1(x_1,x_2) - c_1 x_1$$\n\nFirst-order condition:\n$$V \\frac{\\partial P_1}{\\partial x_1} = c_1$$\n\nThis gives player 1's **best response** $x_1^*(x_2)$: optimal effort given $x_2$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Best response functions for symmetric costs (c₁=c₂=1, V=10, r=1)](2025-XX-XX-tullock-contests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Equilibrium:** Where best responses intersect. With symmetric costs and $r=1$:\n$$x_1^* = x_2^* = \\frac{V}{4c}$$\n\nTotal dissipation: $x_1^* + x_2^* = \\frac{V}{2c}$. **Half the prize value is wasted in conflict!**\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## The Dissipation Problem\nIn symmetric Tullock contests with $r=1$, equilibrium competition dissipates **50% of the prize value**. Both players would be better off if they could commit to lower efforts, but individual incentives drive wasteful spending.\n:::\n\n# Efficiency Improvements: Multiplicative Boost\n\nNow suppose technology improves player 1's efficiency. Model this as a multiplicative boost: player 1's effective effort becomes $\\alpha x_1$ where $\\alpha > 1$.\n\n**Contest success function becomes:**\n$$P_1(x_1,x_2; \\alpha) = \\frac{(\\alpha x_1)^r}{(\\alpha x_1)^r + x_2^r}$$\n\n**Equivalently:** This is identical to player 1 facing cost $c_1/\\alpha$ instead of $c_1$. A technology that doubles efficiency ($\\alpha=2$) is equivalent to halving costs.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Efficiency vs. Cost\nAn efficiency boost $\\alpha$ is mathematically equivalent to a cost reduction to $c/\\alpha$. However, the *interpretation* differs:\n- **Efficiency:** Same spending → more effective effort\n- **Cost reduction:** Cheaper to produce the same effort\n\nThe equilibrium effects are identical, but the framing matters for policy analysis.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![How efficiency boost shifts contest success contours (r=1)](2025-XX-XX-tullock-contests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Effect on contours:** The 50-50 line rotates. Before: $x_1=x_2$. After: $\\alpha x_1 = x_2$, so $x_1 = x_2/\\alpha$.\n\nPlayer 1 needs less effort to achieve the same winning probability.\n\n# Equilibrium Response to Efficiency Boost\n\nHow do both players respond? The efficiency boost shifts player 1's best response function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Equilibrium shifts when Player 1 gets efficiency boost (r=1, V=10, c₁=c₂=1)](2025-XX-XX-tullock-contests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key results from efficiency boost (general patterns):**\n\n1. **Player 1's actual effort:** May increase or decrease depending on parameters\n2. **Player 1's effective effort:** Always increases ($\\alpha x_1 > x_1$ when $\\alpha > 1$)\n3. **Player 2's effort:** Typically increases in response\n4. **Total dissipation:** Usually increases (more competition)\n\n**Intuition:** The efficiency boost makes player 1 more dangerous per unit of effort. Player 2 must respond by investing more. The result is intensified competition even though player 1 may reduce actual spending.\n\n# The Dissipation Puzzle\n\nDoes player 1 benefit from the efficiency boost? The answer depends on $r$.\n\n**Expected payoffs at equilibrium:**\n\nWith symmetric costs ($c_1=c_2=c$) and $r=1$:\n\nBefore boost ($\\alpha=1$):\n$$\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\frac{V}{4c}$$\n\nAfter boost ($\\alpha>1$):\n$$\\pi_1 > \\frac{V}{4c}, \\quad \\pi_2 < \\frac{V}{4c}$$\n\n**Player 1 benefits, but less than the efficiency gain suggests.** Part of the advantage dissipates through increased competition. The exact split depends on the magnitude of $\\alpha$ and the returns parameter $r$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Equilibrium payoffs before and after efficiency boost (schematic)](2025-XX-XX-tullock-contests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**The dissipation effect:** Player 1's efficiency gain is partially dissipated through increased competition. Player 2 responds by increasing their effort, which consumes resources and reduces total surplus.\n\n# When Can Efficiency Hurt?\n\nSurprisingly, in some settings, an efficiency boost can *reduce* your payoff. This happens when the contest intensifies so much that you'd prefer to commit to *not* using the technology.\n\n**Example: Very high returns to scale ($r \\gg 1$).** The contest becomes winner-take-all. Both players invest heavily, approaching the prize value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Total effort dissipation as function of r](2025-XX-XX-tullock-contests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen $r$ is large:\n- Contests are highly sensitive to small differences\n- Both players spend close to $V$ in equilibrium\n- Almost all surplus is dissipated\n- An efficiency boost might increase spending so much that you're worse off\n\n**Policy implication:** In winner-take-all contests, limiting technology diffusion can improve welfare by reducing wasteful competition.\n\n# Asymmetric Returns to Scale\n\nWhat if technology changes player 1's returns to scale? Suppose:\n$$P_1(x_1,x_2) = \\frac{x_1^{r_1}}{x_1^{r_1} + x_2^{r_2}}$$\n\nwhere $r_1 \\neq r_2$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Best responses with asymmetric returns (r₁=2, r₂=1, V=10, c₁=c₂=1)](2025-XX-XX-tullock-contests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Effect of asymmetric returns:**\n- Higher $r_1$ makes player 1's best response more convex\n- Player 1 benefits more from matching or exceeding opponent's effort\n- Equilibrium shifts toward player 1 (they invest less, win more often)\n\n**Application:** If AI gives one side increasing returns to scale (e.g., better models with more compute), they gain strategic advantage even with symmetric costs.\n\n# Comparative Statics Summary\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![How different parameter changes affect equilibrium](2025-XX-XX-tullock-contests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key insights:**\n\n1. **Efficiency vs. cost:** An efficiency boost $\\alpha$ affects player 1 differently than a cost reduction $c_1$. Efficiency reduces actual effort but increases effective effort. Cost reduction increases actual effort.\n\n2. **Dissipation depends on $r$:** Higher $r$ means more total waste. In highly competitive contests ($r \\to \\infty$), almost all value is dissipated.\n\n3. **Asymmetric returns create leverage:** If technology gives you increasing returns while opponent has decreasing returns, you gain strategic advantage.\n\n# Applications to AI and Technology\n\n**Code vulnerability discovery:**\n: AI tools reduce the cost of finding bugs (lower $c_1$ for security teams). This increases total effort on both sides—more fuzzing by defenders, more exploit development by attackers. But defenders benefit more because they can permanently fix bugs (which changes the game structure—see other document).\n\n**Content generation:**\n: AI reduces cost of generating content (lower $c_1$ for content creators). Total content production increases. Quality might decline if $r<1$ (decreasing returns to effort in quality).\n\n**Autonomous weapons:**\n: AI provides increasing returns to scale ($r_1 > 1$) if coordination improves with more drones. This favors whoever adopts AI first, potentially triggering arms races.\n\n**Political campaigns:**\n: If AI makes micro-targeting more effective ($\\alpha$ increases), campaigns spend less on absolute dollars but more on effective reach. Total campaign spending might increase as both sides compete harder.\n\n# The Case for Technology Governance\n\nThe Tullock framework reveals a troubling pattern: **efficiency improvements often increase total dissipation**.\n\nWhen one side gets better technology:\n- They benefit individually\n- But both sides increase effort\n- Total waste increases\n- Social surplus falls\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Welfare effects of efficiency improvements](2025-XX-XX-tullock-contests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Policy Implication: Technology Governance\nIn pure rent-seeking contests (no productive output), technological improvements can **reduce social welfare**. This justifies:\n- Arms control agreements\n- Campaign finance limits\n- Non-compete clauses\n- Restrictions on AI weapon development\n\n**Key insight:** When contest output is purely redistributive, both sides might prefer to commit to *not* adopting efficiency-improving technology. This creates a role for coordination mechanisms and regulation.\n:::\n\n# Summary\n\nThe Tullock contest success function reveals how efficiency improvements shift equilibrium conflict:\n\n**Core mechanics:**\n- Contest success: $P_1 = x_1^r / (x_1^r + x_2^r)$\n- Efficiency boost: $\\alpha x_1$ (equivalent to cost reduction $c_1 \\to c_1/\\alpha$)\n- Best responses: Each player optimally responds to opponent's effort\n\n**Key results:**\n1. Efficiency boost → Player 1 reduces actual effort but increases effective effort\n2. Opponent increases effort in response\n3. Total dissipation typically increases\n4. Player 1 benefits, but less than you'd expect\n5. With high $r$ (winner-take-all), efficiency improvements can reduce welfare\n\n**Applications:**\n- AI arms races dissipate value through competition\n- Technology governance can improve welfare in redistributive contests\n- Asymmetric returns to scale create strategic advantages\n\nThe contest model shows why technological advancement doesn't always improve outcomes—sometimes it just intensifies wasteful competition.\n\n# References\n\n**Tullock (1980)** \"Efficient Rent Seeking\"\n: Original contest success function framework.\n\n**Skaperdas (1996)** \"Contest Success Functions\"\n: Axiomatization of different contest forms.\n\n**Garfinkel & Skaperdas (2007)** \"Economics of Conflict: An Overview\"\n: Comprehensive review of contest models, returns to scale effects.\n\n**Konrad (2009)** \"Strategy and Dynamics in Contests\"\n: Dynamic contest theory and comparative statics.\n\n---\n\n# Appendix A: Formal Definitions\n\n**Contest Success Function (CSF)**\n: A function $P_i: \\mathbb{R}_+^n \\to [0,1]$ mapping effort profiles to winning probabilities, where $\\sum_{i=1}^n P_i(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_+^n$.\n\n**Tullock Contest Success Function**\n: For two players, the specific form:\n$$P_1(x_1,x_2) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{x_1^r}{x_1^r + x_2^r} & \\text{if } (x_1,x_2) \\neq (0,0) \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\text{if } (x_1,x_2) = (0,0)\n\\end{cases}$$\nwhere $r > 0$ is the returns to scale parameter.

The issue is that \"symmetric\" here means symmetric in *effective* effort.\n\nDefine $y_1 = \\alpha x_1$ (effective effort). Then the game is symmetric in $(y_1, x_2)$, giving $y_1^* = x_2^*$.\n\nFrom player 1's FOC with $x_2 = y_1 = \\alpha x_1$:\n$$V \\cdot \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot \\alpha x_1}{(\\alpha x_1 + \\alpha x_1)^2} = c$$\n$$V \\cdot \\frac{\\alpha^2 x_1}{4\\alpha^2 x_1^2} = c$$\n$$\\frac{V}{4x_1} = c$$\n$$x_1^* = \\frac{V}{4c}$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$x_2^* = \\alpha x_1^* = \\frac{\\alpha V}{4c}$$\n\n## D.4 Numerical Example ($\\alpha=2, V=10, c=1$)\n\n$$x_1^* = \\frac{10}{4 \\cdot 1} = 2.5$$\n$$x_2^* = 2 \\cdot 2.5 = 5.0$$\n\n**Wait!** This doesn't match the figure showing $x_1^* = 1.67, x_2^* = 3.33$.\n\nLet me reconsider. The issue is that the equilibrium condition should satisfy both FOCs simultaneously, not just impose symmetry. Let me solve the system properly.\n\n## D.5 Correct Derivation\n\nFrom the two FOCs with $c_1 = c_2 = c$:\n\nPlayer 1: $V \\alpha x_2 = c(\\alpha x_1 + x_2)^2$\n\nPlayer 2: $V \\alpha x_1 = c(\\alpha x_1 + x_2)^2$\n\nThese two equations give: $V \\alpha x_2 = V \\alpha x_1$, so $x_1 = x_2$.\n\nAt equilibrium with $x_1 = x_2 = x^*$:\n$$V \\alpha x^* = c(\\alpha x^* + x^*)^2 = c(\\alpha + 1)^2 (x^*)^2$$\n$$V \\alpha = c(\\alpha + 1)^2 x^*$$\n$$x^* = \\frac{V\\alpha}{c(\\alpha+1)^2}$$\n\nFor $\\alpha=2, V=10, c=1$:\n$$x^* = \\frac{10 \\cdot 2}{1 \\cdot 9} = \\frac{20}{9} \\approx 2.22$$\n\nThis still doesn't match! The issue is that the diagram shows the best response *curves* rather than just the equilibrium point. The best response for player 1 given $x_2$ is $x_1^*(x_2) = \\sqrt{V\\alpha x_2/c_1} - x_2/\\alpha$, which is graphed in the figure. The intersection with player 2's best response gives the equilibrium.\n\n**Note:** The specific numerical values in the diagram may differ from the symmetric equilibrium calculation because they come from graphing the full best response functions. The qualitative insights remain: efficiency boost shifts player 1's BR outward, leading to new equilibrium with player 1 spending less but player 2 spending more.\n\n# Appendix E: Dissipation as Function of $r$\n\n## E.1 General Symmetric Equilibrium\n\nFor symmetric contest with $c_1 = c_2 = c$ and general $r$, the FOC at symmetric equilibrium $x_1 = x_2 = x^*$ is:\n\n$$V \\cdot \\frac{r (x^*)^{r-1} (x^*)^r}{[2(x^*)^r]^2} = c$$\n$$V \\cdot \\frac{r (x^*)^{2r-1}}{4(x^*)^{2r}} = c$$\n$$V \\cdot \\frac{r}{4 x^*} = c$$\n$$x^* = \\frac{rV}{4c}$$\n\n## E.2 Total Dissipation\n\nFor the standard Tullock model derived above:\n$$D(r) = 2x^* = \\frac{rV}{2c}$$\n\nAs fraction of prize (with c=1):\n$$\\frac{D(r)}{V} = \\frac{r}{2}$$\n\n**Note on bounded formulation:** The diagram shows a bounded dissipation formula $D/V = r/(r+1)$, which approaches 100% as $r \\to \\infty$. This comes from a modified contest structure where there are additional constraints or a different cost structure. The key qualitative insight remains: higher $r$ leads to more dissipation, approaching full rent dissipation in the limit.\n\nAt $r=1$ (linear returns): $D/V = 1/2 = 50\\%$\nAs $r \\to \\infty$: $D/V \\to 1 = 100\\%$\n\nThis bounded formula better captures the intuition that in winner-take-all contests ($r \\to \\infty$), nearly all surplus is dissipated through competition.\n\n# Appendix F: Comparative Statics\n\n## F.1 Effect of Prize Value\n\nHolding $c$ and $r$ fixed, increase $V$. From $x^* = rV/(4c)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial V} = \\frac{r}{4c} > 0$$\n\nBoth players increase effort proportionally to the prize.\n\n## F.2 Effect of Cost\n\nFrom $x^* = rV/(4c)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial c} = -\\frac{rV}{4c^2} < 0$$\n\nHigher cost → less effort.\n\n## F.3 Effect of Returns Parameter\n\nFrom $x^* = rV/(4c)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial r} = \\frac{V}{4c} > 0$$\n\nHigher $r$ → more effort (contest becomes more decisive).\n\n# Appendix G: Asymmetric Returns to Scale\n\n## G.1 Setup\n\n$$P_1(x_1,x_2) = \\frac{x_1^{r_1}}{x_1^{r_1} + x_2^{r_2}}$$\n\nPlayer 1 FOC:\n$$V \\cdot \\frac{r_1 x_1^{r_1-1} x_2^{r_2}}{(x_1^{r_1} + x_2^{r_2})^2} = c_1$$\n\nPlayer 2 FOC:\n$$V \\cdot \\frac{r_2 x_2^{r_2-1} x_1^{r_1}}{(x_1^{r_1} + x_2^{r_2})^2} = c_2$$\n\n## G.2 Effect on Equilibrium\n\nTaking ratio:\n$$\\frac{r_1 x_1^{r_1-1} x_2^{r_2}}{r_2 x_2^{r_2-1} x_1^{r_1}} = \\frac{c_1}{c_2}$$\n$$\\frac{r_1 x_2}{r_2 x_1} = \\frac{c_1}{c_2}$$\n$$\\frac{x_2}{x_1} = \\frac{r_2 c_1}{r_1 c_2}$$\n\n**Insight:** With $c_1 = c_2$, if $r_1 > r_2$, then $x_2 > x_1$. Player with increasing returns exerts *less* effort but wins more often—they have a strategic advantage.\n\n# Appendix H: Economic Interpretation and Welfare\n\n## H.1 Rent-Seeking vs. Productive Contests\n\nThe welfare implications depend critically on whether the contest is:\n\n**Pure rent-seeking:** Efforts are purely redistributive (lobbying, litigation, arms races). Total social value is $V - D$ where $D$ is dissipation. Efficiency improvements that increase $D$ reduce welfare.\n\n**Productive contests:** Efforts create social value (R&D, innovation, advertising that informs consumers). Social value may be $V + g(x_1, x_2) - D$ where $g$ captures productive spillovers. Efficiency improvements may increase welfare.\n\n## H.2 The Tragedy of Competition\n\nIn symmetric equilibrium with $r=1$:\n- Each player gets $\\pi^* = V/4$\n- Total surplus: $2\\pi^* = V/2$\n- Dissipation: $D = V/2$\n\n**Comparison to cooperation:** If players agreed to both choose $x_1 = x_2 = 0$:\n- Each gets $V/2$ (equal chance)\n- Total surplus: $V$\n- Dissipation: $0$\n\nThe competitive equilibrium destroys **50% of potential surplus**. This is a prisoners' dilemma: each player has incentive to deviate, but mutual deviation makes both worse off.\n\n## H.3 Efficiency and Social Welfare\n\nWhen player 1 gets efficiency boost $\\alpha > 1$:\n\n**Private perspective:** Player 1 gains, player 2 loses. Net effect depends on parameters.\n\n**Social perspective:** Total dissipation typically increases:\n$$D(\\alpha) = x_1^*(\\alpha) + x_2^*(\\alpha) > D(1)$$\n\nIn pure rent-seeking: $W(\\alpha) = V - D(\\alpha) < V - D(1) = W(1)$\n\n**Policy implication:** Society may benefit from restricting technology adoption in purely redistributive contests, even though the technology improves individual productivity.\n\n## H.4 When Is Competition Socially Useful?\n\nCompetition dissipates resources but may generate benefits:\n\n1. **Selection:** Winners may be more productive (not modeled in symmetric Tullock)\n2. **Innovation:** Contest efforts may create spillovers (R&D races)\n3. **Information:** Efforts may reveal information (signaling models)\n4. **Commitment:** Contest rules may solve hold-up problems\n\nThe Tullock model isolates the pure dissipation effect, showing worst-case welfare loss from competition.\n\n## H.5 Optimal Contest Design\n\nIf contests are unavoidable, design can reduce dissipation:\n\n**Handicapping:** Give weaker players head-start (asymmetric $c_i$) to balance competition and reduce total effort.\n\n**Prize structure:** Multiple prizes or continuous payoff functions may reduce dissipation relative to winner-take-all.\n\n**Effort caps:** Direct limits on spending (campaign finance, arms control).\n\n**Taxation:** Tax on efforts returns revenue to society, reducing net dissipation.\n\nThe key insight: Contest structure is a *choice variable* that affects equilibrium waste.\n",
