I put together the [spreadsheet summary of results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_96kEzP9MFLcBFppVV0Bl7O3Cv9hQFxKArwS2zVCtXE/edit#gid=0) with Dean and Solomon.\n\n**However we can be confident these experiments under-estimate the aggregate effect of Facebook use on polarization.** This is because they are (a) short-run, (b) user-level, (c) manipulate individual features, (d) were run during a period of conservative ranking. If each reason contributes a factor of 2X to effect-sizes then the long-run aggregate effect could be 16X larger than what is measured in these experiments, i.e. meaning we could only rule out an aggregate effect of 0.32 SDs.\n\n**In any case there are other non-experimental reasons to think Facebook hasn't made a large contribution to US polarization.** Specifically (1) Facebook is only a small share of all political exposure, (2) most of the aggregate growth in polarization in the last 40 years was among people without internet access, (3) there are a number of other big potential culprits for polarization growth.\n\n#                 Background\n\n**The New Experiments.** The new papers report on 3 experiments (removing ranking, removing reshares, and downranking like-minded) run for 3 months in late 2020 on Facebook and Instagram. The results show effects on affective polarization of less than 0.03 SD. In the US affective polarization has increased by roughly 0.5 SD over 20 years, so if we compare the raw effects then our CIs would say FB could not have contributed more than 1/25th of this increase.\n\n**Is this effect small or large?** Most of the reporting has described the effects as \"negligible\" or \"undetectable\". I find that a little irritating: we want to know whether the effects are small or large relative to what we expected them to be, that will tell us what we have learned from these experiments.\n\n**What is the question?** It's worth trying to be crisp about the counterfactual: suppose it's the world in whcih there was no social media, and .\n\n**Data.** Dean Eckles, Solomon Messing, and myself put together a rough [spreadsheet summary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_96kEzP9MFLcBFppVV0Bl7O3Cv9hQFxKArwS2zVCtXE/edit#gid=0) of the results from all the experiments reported so far, along with other results from the literature on political effects of media.\n\n**Quality of the papers.** The papers are very impressive pieces of work, and I thank the authors and everyone involved in getting them published. I have a couple of usual complaints about economics research: First, it's very confusing to describe an effect as \"undetectable,\" the reader has no idea how to interpret that without knowing the confidence intervals, every effect is non-zero, we need to focus purely on how large they are. Second, I wish the papers and supplementary materials had far more rich descriptive visualizations, I think it'd give the reader a much better sense of what's going on.\n\n#                 In a Diagram\n\nHere's a simple model of what we're doing:\n$$\\xymatrix{\n*+[F:<5pt>]\\txt{chronological\\\\timeline}  \\ar[dr] & \\\\\n*+[F:<5pt>]\\txt{remove reshares}  \\ar[r] & \n   *+[F:<5pt>]\\txt{exposure\\\\to partisan\\\\content}\\ar[r]|\\gamma &\n   *+[F:<5pt>]\\txt{affective\\\\polarization}\\\\\n   *+[F:<5pt>]\\txt{downrank\\\\likeminded}  \\ar[ur]\n}\n$$\n\nI think none of the three treatments change overall exposure to partisan content (including off-Facebook) by more than around 10%, so I'm a bit doubtful whether we can learn much about the aggregate impact of exposure to partisan content on affective polarization.\n\n#                 Summary of Results\n\n| effects on FB News Feed composition | political | cross-cutting | untrustworthy |\n| ----------------------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| baseline share                      | 14pp      | 21pp          | 3pp           |\n|                                     |           |               |               |\n| - rank chronologically              | +12%      | -10%          | +60%          |\n| - remove reshares                   | -14%      | -3%           | -32%          |\n| - downrank likeminded posts         | -5%       | +7%           | ?             | \n\n[source data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_96kEzP9MFLcBFppVV0Bl7O3Cv9hQFxKArwS2zVCtXE/edit#gid=0)\n\nNote that \"cross-cutting\" \n\n\n#                 Comparing Experimental to Aggregate Effects\n\n\n\n**The cumulative effect of FB on US polarization will likely be larger than measured in this type of experiments:**\n\n1. **Experiments only measure short-run effects.** Most adults have been using FB for around 10 years, compared to a 3 month experiment. If exposure effects have a half-life of 3 months on attitudes then this experiment would measure 1/2 of the long-run impact of each feature on polarization. I find it hard to calibrate dynamic effects: effects of campaign ads seem to tail off quickly, but presumably broad attitudes are affected by long-run familiarity. I would love to find some academic literature on this.^[I could not find *any* discussion of dynamic effects in any of the so-far published experiment analyses, despite each one having an online appendix with around 300 pages of supplementary material.]\n\n2. **Experiments have small effects on exposure to polarizing material.** These experiments each affect only one aspect of FB use, all have effects on Facebook usage of much less than 50%, and on exposure to political material on Facebook of much less than 50%. So the aggregate effect of Facebook withdrawal seems likely to be at least 2X larger than measured by any of these experiments. (Note Allcott's 2018 FB deactivation experiment reduces polarization by 0.16 SD, a large effect, however it's somewhat controversial as the effect is mainly driven by \"exposure to congenial news\" which seems to be somewhat mechanical).\n\n3. **Experiments exclude network effects.** The effects of FB on polarization likely work not just through direct exposure but also (1) through peoples' friends and families; (2) through the accumulation of groups & pages. Thus it seems likely the aggregate effect could be 2X or larger than the individual effect.\n\n4. **Experiments were run during a period of tight restrictions on content.** The experiments ran between September and November 2020. Compared to earlier in the decade this was a period of a relatively sanitized Facebook: (A) Facebook invested very heavily in integrity systems following the 2016 election, reducing prevalence of many types of bad content by factors of between 2X and 10X; (B) prior to and during the 2020 election Facebook implemented a series of extra \"break the glass\" measures with the effect of suppressing extreme or fringe political content. On the other hand during an election there will be more overall political content circulating, so the net bias is hard to predict.\n\nIf each factor contributed a 2X amplification then the aggregate effect would be 16X larger than the experimentally-measured effect, i.e. effective confidence intervals would be 0.32 SDs instead of 0.02SD.\n\n#                 Appendix: Data on Media and Polarization\n\nI have made very rough estimates for affective polarization and for time-spent on partisan content:\n\n|                              | 2004 | 2016 | 2020 |\n| ---------------------------- | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| affective polarization score |  40  |  45  |  50  |\n|                              |      |      |      |\n| minutes/day/adult            |      |      |      |\n| - media                      | 300  | 300  | 300  |\n| - media civic                |  15  |  15  |  15  |\n| - media civic partisan       |  5   |  8   |  6   |\n| - Facebook                   |  0   |  60  |  60  |\n| - Facebook civic             |  0   |  6   |  3   |\n| - Facebook civic partisan    |  0   |  3   |  1   |\n|                              |      |      |      |\n\n@guess2023chronological:\n\n| Share of Impressions       | Facebook | Instagram |\n| -------------------------- | -------- | --------- |\n| Political                  | 14%      | 5%        |\n| Political news             | 6%       | -         |\n| From untrustworthy sources | 3%       | 1%        |\n| Uncivil                    | 3%       | 2%        |\n\n[Pew 2022 report on news platforms](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/news-platform-fact-sheet/?tabId=tab-4ef8dece-845a-4b25-8637-ceb3114503c5)\n\n   |               | pct adults regularly get news from |\n   | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n   | television    | 65%                                |\n   | news websites | 63%                                |\n   | search        | 60%                                |\n   | social media  | 50%                                |\n   | radio         | 47%                                |\n   | print         | 33%                                |\n   | podcasts      | 23%                               |\n\n**Radio show popularity.** Around half of the top 20 most-listened radio shows in the US are conservative talk, with around 90M weekly listeners (this is double-counting overlapping users).\n\n [In 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-listened-to_radio_programs)\n\nThese types of story are common on FB but relatively rare off FB. Most American political media is relatively centre-ist and not exaggerated. The prominent exceptions are political talk radio ([perhaps 40M weekly listeners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-listened-to_radio_programs)) and Fox news ([perhaps 5M regular viewers](http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/2016-ratings-fox-news-channel-is-cable-tvs-most-watched-network/315009)).\n\n\n\n@boxell2022PolarizationTrends document affective polarization across a dozen countries, 1978-2020:\n\n   ![](images/2023-07-27-15-03-32.png)\n\n   1. In the US affective polarization index increased from around 25 to 50, *\"an increase of 1.08 standard deviations as measured in the 1978 distribution.\"*  (I'm not sure if the SD increased).\n\n   2. Across the world there's no clear trend: some countries increased, other countries decreased. This weakens the simple argument that polarization has increased at the same time as social media use.\n\n[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/): Average time-spent 150 minutes/day/person on social networks\n\n#                 Other Evidence on Facebook and Polarization\n\n**Observational data finds that much of the growth in polarization in the US was among people who were not online.** [Boxell et al. 2017](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23258)) say *\"the growth in polarization in recent years [1996-2012] is largest for the demographic groups least likely to use the internet and social media\"*\n\n**The academic literature has identified many other suspects.** I'm not sure there's a consensus. Some potential causes: southern realignment, 1968 changes to the primary system, the Obama presidency, the tea party movement (though each of these could be in part proximal causes). Martin & Yurcoglu (2017) argue that a large part of recent growth is due to cable news: *\"the cable news channels can explain an increase in political polarization of similar size to that observed in the US population over [2000-2008]. ... In absolute terms, however, this increase is fairly small.\"*\n\nSee also Haidt and Bail's long document [Social Media and Political Dysfunction: A Collaborative Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vVAtMCQnz8WVxtSNQev_e1cGmY9rnY96ecYuAj6C548/edit#heading=h.96bogdklzo1j)\n\n#                 Appendix: How to Describe a Null Result\n\n\n**Description of effect sizes from the abstracts:**\n\nGuess et al.
