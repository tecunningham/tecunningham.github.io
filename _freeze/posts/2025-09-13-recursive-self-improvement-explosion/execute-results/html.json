Epoch estimate that algorithmic efficiency has been growing at 3X/year between 2012-2024, measured by effective compute.\n\nForecasters expect an 8-20% chance of an explosion.\n\n: They define an explosion as a 3X speedup in the historical rate of progress by some measure, from the METR/FRI survey.\n\nAI has already been accelerating AI research.\n\n: AI has been self-accelerating for decades: (1) automatic differentiation; (2) bayesian optimization of hyperparameters; (3) neural architecture search; (4) LLM coding autocomplete and chatbots; (5) LLM coding agents.\n\nThere's good theoretical reason to expect an explosion.\n\n: (...)\n\nAI usefulness for optimization depends on features of the setup.\n\n: Hassabis says AI will make progress wherever there's (1) combinatorial search space; (2) clear feedback; (3) lots of data or an automatic validator.\n\n      However there's clearly a fourth condition: that the data has some lower-dimensional latent structure. There are many problems that satisfy the first 3 but where we don't expect substantial progress from autonomous NNs: (A) the telephone book; (B) mapping out stars in the sky; (C) documenting the genome.\n\n\nAI speedups to discovery depends on the shape of the underlying landscape.\n\n: (abc)\n\n\n#           Models\n\nAK model of recursive growth.\n\n: Suppose we have $Y=AK^\\alpha$, and also we use some share $s$ of output on R&D, which increases productivity $A=sY^\\beta$, then if $\\beta+\\alpha>1$ we get a continuously increasing growth rate. Aghion, Jones and Jones (2017) elaborate on this model, where AI gradually is able to take over human tasks, & they get a similar condition.\n\n: The critical question is whether the returns to R&D effort are sufficiently steep. Some classic papers: Bloom et al. \"are we running out of ideas\"; and Erdil. \n\nLandscape model.\n: asdf\n\n\n\n#           Figure / Evals\n\nQ: what evals would be useful?

At what time horizon do we forecast models beating human-level ability at training models?\n2. Do we see grokking, i.e. discontinuous jumps in model-training ability?\n3.

Then growth over time will be characterized by the extreme value distribution of the underlying distribution, & returns to experience will depend on the thickeness of tails. Alternative assumptions:\n\n      - Bounded: growth slows as it approaches a ceiling.\n      - Exponential (thin tails): $A=\\ln n$\n      - Pareto (thick tails): $A = n^\\gamma$\n\n   Note: (1) I think this will imply lumpy growth; (2) this misses out the Jones shoulders-of-giants effect. \n\nErdil, Besiroglu, Ho (2024) [\"Estimating Idea Production: A Methodological Survey\"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4814445)\n: They discuss the difficulty of estimating the returns to R&D on productivity across a few different domains. They have nice estimates for chess inputs & outputs.

He talks about the first wave of ML models: \"The transition to ICT-based production has largely proceeded at the production system level, not the task level.\"[^bresnahan] \n\n\n[^bresnahan]: \"My empirical conclusion about these applications is that the lazy idea of AI – that is, of computer systems that are able to perform productive tasks previously done by humans– is irrelevant to understanding how these technologies create value. Here “irrelevant” does not mean that substitution of machine for human tasks is less important than other determinants of the value in use of AITs. It means irrelevant: task-level substitution of machine for human plays no role in these highly valuable systems.\"\n\n\n#          Overflow / Offcuts\n\nSome optimization landscapes that were already conquered.\n: - _People used to compile tables by doing manual calculations_ -- digits of pi, values for pi, tolerance ranges of metals, random numbers.\n   - _Simplex optimization_ -- very many optimization problems can now be brute-forced. We already knew the algorithms, but it was slow to compute by hand.

If $\\dot{S}_t=S_t^{1-\\beta}$, so you get explosion if $\\beta<0$, steady-state growth if $\\beta=0$, and gradual slowing if $\\beta>1$.\n   - Now if you start automating inputs, the effective exponent gradually gets higher.\n\n- Multi-sector version.\n   - You gradually automate some of the things, so they can be done with capital.\n   - You have spillovers between different processes.\n\n- Estimates of $\\beta$:\n   - Bloom overall $\\beta=3$\n   - For software R&D they estimate $\\beta=3$\n   - they say in software $\\beta=0.1$\n\n- NOTE: $\\beta$\n\n- Questions:\n   - Any historical domain where we've seen regimes of $\\beta<0$?\n\n\n##       my observations\n\n\n- Q: how to think about the growth effect of uplift vs automation?\n \n- Automation makes things *free*, rather than being produced by capital.\n\n\n\n##       tom houlden questions\n\nQ: is this graphical system novel?\n\nQ: is there a nice metaphor/analogy to think about automation/explosion?\n\n\n\n\n#                chart\n\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n  RD[\"R&D\"] --> algorithms\n  RD_compute[\"R&D compute\"] --> algorithms\n  algorithms --> intelligence\n  compute --> intelligence\n  data --> intelligence\n  intelligence -->|??| economic_value[\"economic value\"]\n  intelligence -->|??| RD\n```\n\n# 2026-01-07 |                      tkwa  model\n\nhttps://github.com/tkwa/ai-takeoff-model/blob/main/notes.md\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n   S'(t) &= R(t) S^{1 -

E.g. replacing tollbooth operator with automatic tollbooth.\n    2. _Partial automation._ There's some subset of tasks, and you replace them one-by-one.\n    3. _Speedup._ -> Humans and agents are complements, an agent increases efficiency on all tasks.\n\nConcrete assumptions.\n:  \n    1. _Autonomous algorithm-search machine._ You spend a lot of tokens, it autonomously learns to navigate the space. Like AlphaZero, trained from scratch.\n    2. _Speeds up routine tasks._ The AI R&D guy can do certain things quicker, e.g. parse logs, write visualization, fix bugs.\n    3. _Shares knowledge._ Can learn tricks. It doesn't affect people at the frontier very much.\n\nQ: what if the capability frontier is the data frontier?\n: - Nice prediction: will not speed up experts, only behind the frontier.\n\nNatural processes often have explosive *regions*.\n: You \n\n##    metaphors\n\nDrawing balls from an urn.\n: There's some distribution of values, then you get a very nice expression. The expected value of $N$ draws just depends on the distribution of values $v$, & the extreme-value distribution. This is exactly Kortum (1997).\n\nA tool factory makes better tools.\n: I think this is Jones' metaphor. *Distinct* from Kortum, because the returns to search now depends on the stock of ideas.\n\nLego.\n: Weitzmann's recombinant search is like this: you combine ideas to make new ideas, now you have a larger stock of ideas to combine.\n\nRecipes.\n: You try out recipes, which are combinations of prior recipes. @jones2023recipes\n\nBlacksmith.\n: You have a hammer and you spend time making horseshoes, or working on a new hammer.\n: A harder hammer both (1) makes horseshoes faster, or (2) makes your hammer still harder.\n",
