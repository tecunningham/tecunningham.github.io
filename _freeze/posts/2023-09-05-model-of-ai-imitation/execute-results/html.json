It would seem to follow that such a model would never be *better* at answering questions than a human.[^objective]\n   \n   [^objective]: In addition many other ML models are trained on human-generated labels, instead of any deeper ground truth: image recognition, language understanding, text classification, medical diagnosis.\n\n**In a formal model, imitative AI can beat humans for three reasons:**\n\n   1. **Averaging out error.** Different humans give different answers to a question, and so if an LLM can consistently give the average answer it will do better than the average human (the error of the average being always smaller than the average of the error).\n   2. **Specialization.** People tend to write about what they know, and so an LLM which learns to predict the typical answer to a given question will sound like a specialist in all areas: it will answer questions about water like a hydrologist and questions about bugs like an entomologist (although it will also answer questions about astrology like an astrologist).\n   3. **Interpolation.** An LLM will interpolate responses from different humans, and this interpolation can be functionally equivalent to inference, meaning an LLM will sometimes be able to reliably answer questions that *no* human can answer.\n\n**Additionally AI can learn and use tacit human knowledge.** The majority of human knowledge is tacit, meaning it is used in forming judgments but we do not have conscious access to that knowledge. If AI models can accurately predict human judgments then the weights in those models effectively contain that tacit knowledge, and so the model can be re-engineered to use that knowledge in ways that humans cannot. I will discuss tacit knowledge more in a followup post.\n\n**This blog post contains:** (1) a simple visual illustration of the argument; (2) a formal model and derivation of the claims above; (3) discussion of evidence that LLMs are able to perform super-human tasks; (4) discussion of applications, related literature, and complications. This is work in progress and I'm planning to keep adding material to this post.\n\n#           Setup: Questions and Answers\n\n**For concreteness I will describe humans and computers answering questions about the world.** However I think the basic framework applies generally to performing tasks or following instructions.

When asked which question would get the highest answer, i.e. what is the maximum of this function, then they will choose the maximum of the pink curve. However the computer could learn the red curve and algorithmically find the maximum, substantially outperforming the human.\n\n   In fact I think this is an accurate description of image synthesis by neural nets: models are first trained to recognize images given captions, and then a new image can be synthesized to match a given caption, e.g. through a diffusion algorithm. Here there's a striking asymmetry: these algorithms can approximately match average human performance in recognition, but they far outperform human performance in construction of new artefacts.\n\n\n#           Evidence on Superhuman Performance\n\n**Summary.** This table shows the year in which a computer (or mechanical device) could match performance with the best human:\n\n   |                                 |           |\n   | ------------------------------- | --------- |\n   | arithmetic                      | 1642      |\n   | chess                           | 1997      |\n   | Jeopardy                        | 2005      |\n   | image recognition (ImageNet)    | 2015      |\n   | handwriting recognition (MNIST) | 2015      |\n   | question answering (SQuAD1.1)   | 2019      |\n   | difficult math questions (MATH) | 2023      |\n   | coding problems (MBPP)          | (not yet) |\n\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n   ![](images/2023-09-19-09-55-57.png)\n:::\n\n**Computers have hit the ceiling on most benchmarks.**  @kiela2023plottingprogress documents that most computer benchmarks have become \"saturated,\" i.e. computers get close-to-perfect performance, and that recently the speed of saturation has become quicker (see graph on right). They say identify only a single benchmark where performance is not close to the human baseline, and most of the models they discuss are imitation learning. As a consequence some work has moved to evaluating models against examples specifically on \"adversarial\" tasks chosen to fool computers (e.g. Dynabench, @kiela2021dynabench).^[@kiela2021dynabench also say that \"models that achieve super-human performance on benchmark tasks (according to the narrow criteria used to define human performance) nonetheless fail on simple challenge examples and falter in real-world scenarios.\"]\n   \n**On some benchmarks no computer could ever beat human performance.** On some tasks human performance effectively *is* the ground truth, and so by definition computers could never beat humans. This is roughly true for text comprehension: a sentence has a given meaning if and only if the average person believes it has that meaning. When we observe computer outperformance it is because either (1) there is human variation and the computer output is more consistent; or (2) computers outperform amateur humans but the ground truth is expert humans.\n\n\n##          Performance by Task\n\n***Arithmetic*: computers passed humans 300 years ago.** Machines have been used to do calculations since the 17th century, e.g. [Pascal's calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_calculator) from 1642.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n   |             |  |\n   | ----------- | --------------------------------- |\n   | Backgammon  | 1979                              |\n   | Chess       | 1997                              |\n   | Jeopardy    | 2005                              |\n   | Atari games | 2013                              |\n   | Go          | 2016                              |\n   | Starcraft   | 2019                              |\n   ([source](https://historyofyesterday.com/the-brutal-history-of-ai-defeating-every-human/))\n:::\n\n***Playing games*: computers passed humans over the last 45 years.** See the table in the margin for games. I am not aware of any well-known games in which computers cannot reliably beat the best humans.\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n   ![](images/2023-09-18-08-13-45.png)\n   ([source](https://ourworldindata.org/brief-history-of-ai))\n:::\n***Image recognition*: computers surpassed humans in the 2010s.** With the qualifications above about the limitations of benchmark tasks.\n\n***Question answering*: computers surpassed humans in the 2010s.** With the qualifications above about the limitations of benchmark tasks.\n\n\n***Coding*: computers still below expert.** See the benchmarks on [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/task/code-generation), also a graph on [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ai-performance-coding-math-knowledge-tests), specifically [APPS](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/apps) and [MBPP](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/code-generation-on-mbpp). The best-performing computers are still imperfect at solving these coding challengers (which presumably can be solved by an expert programmer), but progress is rapid.\n   \n***Writing persuasive text*: computer comparable to average human.** A number of recent papers compare the persuasive power of LLM-generated text to human-generated text (@bai2023persuade, @goldstein2023persuasive, @hackenburg2023persuasive, @matz2023personalized, @palmer2023large, @qin2023large). They all find that LLMs do relatively well, but none show clear signs of computer superiority.\n\n***Writing creative blurbs*: computer comparable to average human.** @koivisto2023creativity compared GPT4 to online recruited humans (¬£2 for a 13 minute task) in giving \"creative\" uses for everyday items. The prompt was to \"come up with original and creative uses for an object\", objects were \"rope\", \"box\", \"pencil\" and \"candle.\" The responses were rated by humans for their \"creativity\" or \"originality.\" GPT-4 responses were perhaps 1SD above the average human score, but the difference was smaller when choosing just the best response for each user.\n\n***Summarizing text*: computer beats average human.** @lee2023rlaif reports that LLM-generated summaries of articles were preferred by humans to human-generated summaries 80% of the time. However the paper doesn't give much detail about the conditions of the humans writing the summaries.[^summarization]\n\n   [^summarization]: *\"RLAIF summaries are preferred over the reference [human-written] summaries 79% of the time, and RLHF are preferred over the reference summaries 80% of the time.\"*\n\n***Doing math problems*: computer comparable to expert.** The latest score on the [MATH benchmark](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/math-word-problem-solving-on-math) is 84%, compared to 90% by a three-time IMO gold medalist. The scores have been rising very rapidly so it seems likely that computers will soon surpass humans.^[@hendrycks2021measuring says \"We found that a computer science PhD student who does not especially like mathematics attained approximately 40% on MATH, while a three-time IMO gold medalist attained 90%\"]\n\n<!-- K√∂bis, N. & Mossink, L. D. \"Artificial intelligence versus Maya Angelou: Experimental evidence that people cannot differentiate AI-generated from human-written poetry.\" Comput. Human Behav. 114, 106553 (2021). -->\n\n#           Discussion\n\n**Training on custom-written text.** Recent LLMs don't train just on predicting existing text (books, internet, twitter) they also use datasets of instructions and responses generated by paid raters (@ouyang2022training). We can still call this imitation but it's putting relatively more weight on imitating the responses of specific set of people, the paid raters. This significantly improves performance on most benchmarks, but I think it also has costs: the model is now predicting output of a specific set of people (i.e. non-expert paid raters), and so conceivably will do less well at incorporating niche information available to an expert.\n\n**Training on evaluation instead of production.** Recent LLMs are not purely imitative, e.g. OpenAI's GPT models are trained with human *evaluation* of their responses (called reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).[^RLHF] The key difference is that the goal reflects how humans rate responses, rather than how humans generate responses. In some domains the two functions might be identical, but in others there's a clear difference. This can have both costs and benefits: .\n\n   This dramatically improves performance on instruction-following benchmarks. This is different from imitative learning insofar as humans have an asymmetry between their production and evaluation of responses: between how they follow an instruction and how they evaluate other people following that instruction.\n\n   <!-- The second type is somewhat different because we're now using human *evaluation* instead of human *production*, and so the surface being fitted is distinct. However I do not think the RLHF fundamentally changes the argument in this note, and in fact the InstructGPT paper shows that a purely imitative model's performance continues to trend upwards as model size increases, implying that capabilities of current-level RLHF models could be achieved with pure imitation with sufficiently large model and training-set size.\n   -->\n\n   [^RLHF]: E.g. see OpenAI's 2022 InstructGPT (@ouyang2022training). Technically the reinforcement learning is against a model trained to predict the human evaluation of outputs.\n\n**The importance of tacit knowledge.** The relative success of machine learning over symbolic AI has often been connected to the importance of tacit human knowledge, e.g. by Geoff Hinton. I have written a lot about the importance of tacit knowledge in human decision-making ([post](https://tecunningham.github.io/posts/2017-12-10-unconscious-influences.html), [paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=MDB_DgkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=MDB_DgkAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC), [paper](http://jondequidt.com/pdfs/paper_implicit.pdf)).\n\n**Do current LLMs outperform humans?** I will consider GPT-4 as a specific LLM.\n\n   1. **For any given human, GPT-4 clearly can beat them on some domains.** GPT-4 has an encylopedic ability to answer questions, so for any individual human they can clearly outperform them on a large set of questions.\n   2. **Modern LLMs can translate between two languages with no common speaker.** Modern language models can translate between arbitrary pairs of language. I haven't seen explicit confirmation of this, but I assume this includes pairs for which there exists no common speaker and I assume that a purely imitative LLM would be able to do at least rudimentary translation.\n   3. **Modern LLMs can combine capabilities.** GPT-4 is good at combining two different capabilities, e.g. writing a sonnet about quantum theory, or a ballad in Spanish about New Zealand. It seems likely there are many such combination tasks which no single human could perform unaided.\n\n**Other discussion of super-human performance by LLMs.** I have found surprisingly little online or academic discussion about whether LLMs will hit a ceiling defined by human performance. A good paper by @bowman2023eight has a section titled \"human performance on a task isn‚Äôt an upper bound on LLM performance.\" He says LLMs can outperform humans for two reasons: (1) \"they are trained on far more data than any human sees,\" and (2) \"they are often given additional training using reinforcement learning ... which trains them to produce responses that humans find helpful without requiring humans to demonstrate such helpful behavior.\" I think this discussion misses the more fine-grained reasons why a purely imitative LLM can outperform humans (averaging, specialization, interpolation, and using tacit knowledge).\n\n**Computers can never outperform the best human on language understanding tasks.** The ground truth about language interpretation is defined by how humans interpret that language, and so a computer can never outperform this.[^buffalo] E.g. in benchmarks for natural language understanding the labels are typically written by the human authors of the benchmark (@tedeschi2023s). In content moderation the definition of ground truth is typically either majority-vote among paid human raters, or the reflective judgment of a senior human employee. It follows that a computer could outperform the average human only by reducing noise, or by better-approximating the output of a specific human.[^wins]\n\n   The same point applies to computer performance on exam problems: in almost all cases the person who wrote the exam can get a perfect score and so a computer could never outperform that person.\n\n   [^wins]: Many recent language models do outperform the average human baseline on language understanding tasks, but @tedeschi2023s argue that for a variety of reasons the strength of these results is significantly exaggerated.\n\n   [^buffalo]: There are arguably exceptions but I don't think they are quantitatively important. Consider the sentence \"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo\": it does have at least one well-defined meaning according to the typical rules of English but arguably no human would correctly identify that meaning unless specifically prompted. A computer trained only on human comprehension could plausibly identify its meaning.\n\n**Computers can outperform humans on recognition tasks.** Most benchmarks for media recognition use human labels, e.g. for object detection in photos or speech recognition in audio. However humans can be mistaken: they might incorrectly think a photo has a dog in it when it does not or vice versa. Humans are very good at recognition, so human-labelled data has been sufficient, but computers are liable to exceed human performance on these tasks.[^groundTruth]\n\n   [^groundTruth]: In fact defining ground truth is somewhat complicated because an image is consistent with an infinite variety of objects causing that arrangement of pixels, we can only talk about an image representing an object because of priors about typical scenes. So the ground truth of interest must be something like \"in ordinary circumstances, what is the probability that these pixels would be caused by a scene with a dog in them.\"\n\n**The graphical model underplays the importance of architecture.** The graphical model shown above represents both questions and answers as unidimensional, and it makes it seem that a small sample is sufficient to get a reasonably good approximation of the true function. In reality the questions are very high dimensional and most architectures fail to get a good fit. Neural nets with transformer structure have had remarkable success in fitting the data.\n\n**Computers can outperform humans by averaging out error (\"wisdom of crowds\").** An additional reason for superhuman performance, not illustrated in the graphical argument above, is that they can average out variance in how humans report their answers, whether that variance is due to noise in perception, belief formation, or in recording human answers. We could illustrate this with multiple red lines at step 2: it's clear that if the computer tries to predict the average human response then it will end up closer to the ground truth than the average human. More generally: the average error will necessarily be larger than the error of the average, by Jensen's inequality.\n\n**Specalization depends on people writing what they know.** The \"specialization\" result above depends on a correlation between evidence and error: for any given question the answer observed in the training data is more likely to come from a human who has direct experience (and so lower error). This seems a reasonable assumption, that people typically write about what they know. However there are a clear cases where the opposite occurs: where the people who write the most about a topic are the people who have the least accurate beliefs about it, e.g. conspiracy theories, politically partisan issues, or astrology. In these cases we would expect AI to answer question copying these people.^[Analogically, in music or visual art, there might be some genres where the people who create artworks are uniquely bad at it, and so in these genres imitative AI would learn to make artworks worse than the average human would make.]\n\n**Alternative definitions of superhuman abilities.** We can formalize \"superhuman\" abilities in a variety of ways, e.g.:\n\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      \\text{weak:}&& \\ut{E[a(q)-\\bar{a}(q)]^2}{error of computer}\n         &\\leq  \\ut{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nE[a(q)-\\hat{a}_i(q)]^2}{avg error of human}\\\\\n      \\text{medium:}&& \\ut{E[a(q)-\\bar{a}(q)]^2}{error of computer}\n         &\\leq  \\ut{E\\left[a(q)-\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\hat{a}_i(q)\\right]^2}{error of avg human}\\\\\n      \\text{strong:}&& \\ut{E[a(q)-\\bar{a}(q)]^2}{error of computer}\n         &\\leq  \\ut{\\min_{i=1,\\ldots,n}E[a(q)-\\hat{a}_i(q)]^2}{error of best human}\\\\\n      \\text{super-strong:}&& \\ut{E[a(q)-\\bar{a}(q)]^2}{error of computer}\n         &\\leq  \\ut{E[\\min_{i=1,\\ldots,n}\\{a(q)-\\hat{a}_i(q)\\}]^2}{error of best human by question}\\\\\n   \\end{aligned}$$\n\n   Note that we cannot rank benchmark #2 and #3: the error of the best human could be either higher or lower than the error of the average human. \n\n**AI could be used to create super-human artefacts.** There has been a lot of discussion about whether AI be used to exceed human abilities to create certain artefacts, e.g. hyper-beautiful paintings, hyper-addictive clickbait, hyper-persuasive text. Using the existing architecture of LLMs, which predict human outputs, this is unlikely: they might be able to predict the objects that a very talented human would produce, but would not surpass their ability. However AI could be used to generate artfeacts indirectly: instead of predicting how a human would create such an arfect, the weights that the AI has learned could be used to find the artefact which maximizes the function of interest, e.g. hyper-persuasive, or hyper-beautiful. In this way the AI could create artefacts beyond the ability of any human. This is roughly how image synthesis algorithms work: after training a model to recognize images, new images can be created by maximizing the learned weights.\n\n**Economic implication: imitative AI brings everybody to the knowledge frontier.** An imitative LLM can effectively serve as a consultant: it will tell you how a domain-expert would answer your question. For some problems we've already been able to do that for a long time, e.g. a textbook will tell you scientific advice on crop management practices, but LLMs allow for much subtler contingencies and to incorporate tacit knowledge. We should therefore expect the productivity impact of LLMs to be mainly on those who are behind the knowledge frontier, and we might also expect a compression of incomes.\n   <!-- 3. By pooling all the information in the training set LLMs allow everybody to have expert-level judgment on a given subject, and so give relatively bigger advantage to those with less knowledge. -->\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-10_cb8c4fc2e93fe9ef20d44cff13e8f051'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Venn diagram representation.** This diagram shows an alternative way of representing some of the core claims: in general the questions answerable by an LLM will not be a subset of the questions answered in the training set, or even those answerable by the people who contributed to the training set. The Venn diagram's disadvantage, relative to the visualizations above, is that it does not represent the mechanics of *why* the LLM can outperform humans, while the diagram above can be use to separately show four distinct reasons (averaging error, specialization, interpolation, and using tacit knowledge).\n\n**Imitation learning in dynamic problems.** The discussion in this note has been about a purely static problem of supplying answers to questions, but text generation can also be considered as a dynamic problem of sequentially generating tokens. A common observation regarding dynamic policy is that pure prediction of expert behaviour (\"behavioural cloning\") is not very robust, and this has been used to explain weaknesses in the behaviour of autoregressive generative text models.[^OOD]\n\n[^OOD]: @cundy2023sequencematch say \"[the] simple behaviour cloning approach results in a compounding error problem, where the further the trained model gets from the typical expert states, the worse the model performs, incurring increasing error.\" I also found [these notes](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs237b/pdfs/lecture/cs237b_lecture_12.pdf) from Stanford's CS273B useful.\n\n#           Linear Model\n\n**Here I give a more formal model and derive some results.** I wrote this model before coming up with the graphical argument above. There is a substantial overlap in implications, but I think there is some value in this linear model in the precision with which we define each quantity. The model has three steps:\n\n   $$\\xymatrix@C=.5cm@R=0cm{\n      \\text{world}\n      && \\text{human}\n      && \\text{LLM}\\\\\n      *+[F:<5pt>]{\\bm{w}} \\ar[rr]^{\\bm{a}=Q\\bm{w}}\n      && *+[F:<5pt>]{\\hat{\\bm{w}}} \\ar[rr]^{\\hat{\\bm{a}}=\\hat{Q}\\hat{\\bm{w}}}\n      && *+[F:<5pt>]{\\bar{\\bm{w}}} \\ar[rr]^{\\tilde{a}=\\tilde{q}'\\bar{\\bm{w}}}\n      && \\  \\\\\n      \\txt{unobserved\\\\truth\\\\about\\\\the\\\\world}\n      & \\txt{answers\\\\to\\\\human\\\\questions}\n      & \\txt{beliefs\\\\formed\\\\by\\\\human}\n      & \\txt{text\\\\written\\\\by\\\\human}\n      & \\txt{LLM\\\\model\\\\of\\\\human\\\\text}\n      & \\txt{LLM's\\\\answers\\\\to\\\\new\\\\questions}\n   }$$\n\n**Questions and answers.** A question is defined by a set of binary attributes ($q_1,\\ldots,q_n\\in\\{-1,1\\}$), and the answer is a linear function of those attributes given some unobserved weights $w_1,\\ldots,w_n$ (see below for derivation):\n\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      \\ut{\\bmatrix{a^1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a^m}}{answers}\n         = \\ut{\\bmatrix{q_1^1 w_1 + \\ldots q_n^1w_n \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ q_1^m w_1 + \\ldots q_n^mw_n}}{questions}\n   \\end{aligned}$$\n\n\n**Human beliefs.** After observing a set of question and their real-world answers the human will form beliefs about the weights $w_1,\\ldots,w_n$. We can explicitly write the human posteriors if we assume their priors are Gaussian and i.i.d. ($\\bm{w}\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2I)$):[^covariance]\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      \\bm{a}        &= Q\\bm{w}\n         && \\text{(questions \\& answers given true weights $\\bm{w}$)}\\\\\n      \\hat{\\bm{w}} &= Q'(QQ')^{-1}\\bm{a}\n         && \\text{(human estimate of true weights $\\bm{w}$)}\n   \\end{aligned}$$\n\n   I will assume that the number of unobserved weights is large relative to the human's experience ($n\\gg m$), so the human will gradually learn more about reality as she observes the answer to more questions, and will be able to perfectly answer any question she's seen before, but will never learn the full set of weights.\n\n   [^covariance]: I am assuming $\\bm{w}$ has zero-mean and is i.i.d. just to cut down on notation, the results all hold for the more general multivariate Normal case.\n\n**Computer beliefs.** Suppose that humans write down some set of question and answer them given their beleifs. We use that text to train a computer to predict the answer given any question, and the computer likewise assumes a linear model with i.i.d. Gaussian weights. Then we can explicitly write the computer-estimated weights:\n\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      \\hat{\\bm{a}}        &= \\hat{Q}\\hat{\\bm{w}}\n         && \\text{(human-generated questions \\& answers)}\\\\\n      \\bar{\\bm{w}} &= \\hat{Q}'(\\hat{Q}\\hat{Q}')^{-1}\\hat{\\bm{a}}\n         && \\text{(computer estimate of human weights $\\hat{\\bm{w}}$)}\n   \\end{aligned}$$\n\n**Computer answers.** Finally we can ask the computer a new question, $\\tilde{q}$, and observe its answer:\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      \\tilde{a}        &= \\tilde{\\bm{q}}'\\bar{\\bm{w}}\n         && \\text{(computer answer to a novel question $\\tilde{\\bm{q}}$)}\\\\\n   \\end{aligned}$$\n\n\n##           Model Implications\n\n**If one human records all their observations then the computer will perfectly imitate them.** \n:  Suppose that there is one human and they write down all of their observations, $\\hat{Q}=Q$. Then the computer's beliefs will be the same as the human's beliefs ($\\hat{\\bm{w}}=\\bar{\\bm{w}}$), and so the computer will answer every question exactly as the human does, though neither knows the truth ($\\bar{\\bm{w}}\\neq\\bm{w}$).\n\n**If humans do not record all their observation then the computer will perform worse.**\n:  Suppose humans only write down some of their observations, i.e. $\\hat{Q}$ is a row-wise subset of $Q$. Then computers and humans will give the same answers for any question in the training set, but outside of that set computers will generally do worse than humans. And so for every question $\\bm{q}$ the computer will do worse in expectation:\n   $$E[\\ut{(\\bm{q}\\bm{a}-\\bm{q}\\bar{\\bm{a}})^2}{computer error}]\\geq\n      E[\\ut{\\bm{q}(\\bm{a}-\\hat{\\bm{a}})}{human error}].$$\n\n<!-- ADD: will get wisdom-of-crowds if there's noise\n     ADD: mention of old literature on expert systems beating the experts -->\n\n**If there are multiple humans then the computer will outperform them both.**\n: Suppose there are two humans who each observe answers to different question, $Q_A$ and $Q_B$, and they both write them all down, so $\\bar{Q}=(\\smallmatrix{Q_A\\\\Q_B})$ and $\\bar{\\bm{a}}=(\\smallmatrix{Q_A\\bm{w}\\\\Q_B\\bm{w}})$. Now the computer clearly has superior information to either human, and so for both $i\\in\\{1,2\\}$ and every question $\\bm{q}$ we can write:\n      $$E[\\ut{(\\bm{q}\\bm{a}-\\bm{q}\\bar{\\bm{a}})^2}{computer error}]\\leq\n      E[\\ut{\\bm{q}(\\bm{a}-\\hat{\\bm{a}}_i)}{human error}].$$\n\n**If there are multiple humans then the computer can answer question no human can answer.** \n \n: Suppose two humans observe the answers to the following questions:\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      Q_A &= \\bmatrix{1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1} \\\\\n      Q_B &= \\bmatrix{1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -1}\n   \\end{aligned}$$\n      The first human will learn the exact value of $w_2$, and the second human will learn the exact value of $w_3$, but neither will learn both, and so neither could perfectly predict the answer to this question:\n      $$\\begin{aligned}\n         \\tilde{q} &= \\bmatrix{1 & -1 & -1} \\\\\n      \\end{aligned}$$\n\n      However if they both recorded their observations, so the computer observes $\\bar{\\bm{a}}=(\\smallmatrix{Q_1\\bm{w}\\\\Q_2\\bm{w}})$, the computer will be able to infer both $w_2$ and $w_3$, and thus will be able to perfectly answer $\\tilde{q}$.\n\n      We can see this behaviour in LLMs: they sometimes combine a pair of facts or a pair of abilities which no single human has access to, e.g. when an LLM translates between two languages, for which there exists no human speaker of both.\n\n**If humans write outside their expertise then the computer will do worse.** \n\n:     In the cases above we assumed that the two humans recorded only what they directly observed. This means the computer essentially had a window directly to the world. However the humans could instead have written down their estimated answers to other questions. Suppose they both wrote down answers to every possible question, then the computer would learn the *average* of the two human's estimated weights:[^noise]\n   $$\\bar{\\bm{w}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\bm{w}}_A+\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\bm{w}}_B.$$\n\n      Here the computer will do worse than the two humans on the original questions, $Q_A$ and $Q_B$.\n\n      The implication is that LLMs work so well only because people tend to write about what they know. Put another way, when an LLM answers a question, it will not predict the answer given by the average person, but will predict the answer given by people who are likely to answer that question in the real world, and luckily those people tend to be people who are subject-matter experts.\n\n   [^noise]: We would have to augment the computer's learning rule to allow for noise in answers - I need to confirm that the weighting will be exactly 1/2.\n\n\n**If humans have tacit knowledge, the computer model can outperform humans in creation of new artefacts.** \n\n: Suppose humans have tacit knowledge of the world, we can model this with two separate sets of beliefs:\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      \\hat{\\bm{w}}^T   &= \\text{tacit knowledge}\\\\\n      \\hat{\\bm{w}}^E &= \\text{explicit knowledge}\\\\\n   \\end{aligned}$$\n\n      When the human encounters a new question $\\tilde{\\bm{q}}$ they will use their tacit knowledge to form an estimate of the answer, $\\hat{a}=\\tilde{\\bm{q}}'\\hat{\\bm{w}}^T$. For simplicity assume tacit knowledge is perfectly accurate $\\hat{\\bm{w}}^T=\\bm{w}$, and explicit knowledge is imperfect.\n   \n      The distinction becomes important when we want to create a new question. Here it's useful to interpret $\\bm{q}$ not as a question but as an artefact, e.g. text or image, and $\\bm{a}=\\bm{q}'\\bm{w}$ represents some abstract property, e.g. how beautiful or how rhythmic. Suppose we want to chosose $\\bm{q}\\in\\{-1,1\\}^n$ to maximize $\\bm{w}\\bm{q}$. If we had perfect access to our beliefs $\\bm{w}^T$ this would be simple, however if we have access only to imperfect explicit knowledge $\\hat{\\bm{w}}^E$, the artefact which maximizes that function will not generally be the one which maximizes $a$.\n\n      Here the computer model is less constrained. Suppose the computer has observed sufficiently many questions until they have perfectly learned the tacit knowledge, $\\bar{\\bm{w}}=\\hat{\\bm{w}}^T$. Then if computation is free the computer could be used to query every single $\\bm{q}\\in\\{-1,1\\}^n$ to find the best possible artefact.\n\n##           Derivation\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n   Q &= \\bmatrix{q_1^1 & \\ldots & q^1_n \\\\ & \\ddots \\\\ q^m_1 & \\ldots & q^m_n}\n      && \\text{(set of questions)} \\\\\n   w'  &= \\bmatrix{w_1 \\ldots w_n} \\\\\n   a    &= \\bmatrix{a^1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a^m} \n      = \\bmatrix{q_1^1 w_1 + \\ldots q_n^1w_n \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ q_1^m w_1 + \\ldots q_n^mw_n} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      \\bm{w} &\\sim N(0,\\Sigma) \n         && (n\\times 1\\text{ vector of parameters of the world)}\\\\\n      Q      &\\in \\{-1,1\\}^{n\\times m}\n         && \\text{($m$ questions, each has $n$ binary parameters)}\\\\\n      \\ut{\\bm{a}}{$m\\times1$}   &= \\ut{Q}{$m\\times n$}\\ut{\\bm{w}}{$n\\times1$}\n         && \\text{(answers provided by the world)}\\\\\n      \\hat{\\bm{w}} &= E[\\bm{w}|Q,\\bm{a}]\n            && \\text{(human beliefs about the world)}\\\\\n         &= \\ut{\\Sigma Q'}{$Cov(\\bm{w},\\bm{a})$}\n            (\\ut{Q\\Sigma Q'}{$Var(\\bm{a})$})^{-1}\n            \\bm{a}\n   \\end{aligned}$$\n\n**With one observation and two weights.** Suppose $m=1, n=1$, then we have:\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      Q  &= \\bmatrix{q_1 & q_2} \\\\\n      \\bm{a}'  &= \\bmatrix{a} \\\\\n      \\bm{w}'  &= \\bmatrix{w_1 & w_2 } \\\\\n      \\Sigma &= \\bmatrix{\\sigma_1^2 & \\rho \\\\ \\rho & \\sigma_2^2}\\\\\n      \\Sigma Q' &= \\bmatrix{ \\sigma_1^2q_1 + \\rho q_2 \\\\ \\rho q_1 + \\sigma_2^2 q_2 } \\\\\n      Q\\Sigma Q' &= \\bmatrix{ \\sigma_1^2q_1^2 + 2\\rho q_1q_2 + \\sigma_2^2 q_2^2} \\\\\n      \\hat{\\bm{w}}=\\Sigma Q'(Q\\Sigma Q')^{-1}\\bm{a}\n         &= \\bmatrix{ \\frac{\\sigma_1^2q_1 + \\rho q_2}{\\sigma_1^2q_1^2 + 2\\rho q_1q_2 + \\sigma_2^2 q_2^2} \\\\ \n                  \\frac{\\rho q_1 + \\sigma_2^2 q_2}{\\sigma_1^2q_1^2 + 2\\rho q_1q_2 + \\sigma_2^2 q_2^2}} a\n   \\end{aligned}\n   $$\n\nWe can normalize $q_1=q_2=1$, then we have\n   $$\\hat{w}_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_1^2+\\rho}{\\sigma_1^2+2\\rho+\\sigma_2^2}a,$$\n\n   This means we are dividing up responsibility for the answer ($a$) into the contributions of each component, nice and simple.\n\n**With two observations and one weight.** Here we're *over-identified*. \n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      Q  &= \\bmatrix{q^1 \\\\ q^2} \\\\\n      \\bm{a}  &= \\bmatrix{a^1 \\\\ a^2} \\\\\n      \\bm{w}  &= \\bmatrix{w } \\\\\n      \\Sigma &= \\bmatrix{\\sigma^2 }\\\\\n      \\Sigma Q' &= \\bmatrix{ \\sigma^2 q^1 & \\sigma^2 q^2 } \\\\\n      Q\\Sigma Q' &= \\bmatrix{ \\sigma^2 q^1q^1 & \\sigma^2q^1q^2 \\\\ \\sigma^2q^1q^2 & \\sigma^2q^2q^2}\n         && \\text{(this matrix doesn't have an inverse)}\n   \\end{aligned}\n   $$\n\n**With noise.** Suppose we only observe the answers with random noise, then we get this:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n   \\ut{\\bm{a}}{$m\\times1$}   &= \\ut{Q}{$m\\times n$}\\ut{\\bm{w}}{$n\\times1$}\n      + \\ut{\\bm{e}}{$n\\times 1$} \\\\\n   \\bm{e} &\\sim N(\\bm{0},s^2I_m) && \\text{(i.i.d. noise w variance $s^2$)}\\\\\n   Cov(\\bm{w},\\bm{a})   &= \\Sigma Q' \\\\\n   Var(\\bm{a}) &= Q\\Sigma Q' + s^2I_m \\\\\n   E[\\bm{w}|Q,\\bm{q}]   &= \\Sigma Q'(Q\\Sigma Q' + s^2I_m)^{-1}\\bm{a}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n**Compare to Bayesian linear regression.**  We can compare this result to Bayesian linear regression (e.g. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_linear_regression)):\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      \\bar{\\beta}  &= \\Sigma Q'(Q\\Sigma Q' + s^2I_m)^{-1}\\bm{a}\n         && \\text{(our result)} \\\\\n      \\tilde{\\beta} &= (Q'Q+s^{2}\\Sigma^{-1})^{-1}Q'\\bm{a}\n         && \\text{(Bayesian linear regression)}\\\\\n   \\end{aligned}$$\n\n   I *believe* that these can be shown to be equivalent by the [matrix inversion lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_matrix_identity), though I haven't confirmed this.
