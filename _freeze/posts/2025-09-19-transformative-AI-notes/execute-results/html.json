I had just left OpenAI's Economic Research team, & we had just released our paper, [How People Use ChatGPT](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34255).\n\n<!-- Some of the arguments below will be a bit sketchy, many are summarizing blog posts that I'm still working on. -->\n\nThe arguments I will make.\n\n:     1. **There is no standard definition or metric of machine intelligence.** The lack of a definition makes working in this field difficult.\n      1. **There is no standard model of AI's economic impact.** Each author uses their own set of assumptions, and most are quite *ad hoc*.\n      2. **I expect wages to fall eventually.** Many economists have argued that AI will cause wages to rise, even if AI can do everything. However I think they fail to take resource costs seriously: the land and energy required for a human to do some work will be far greater than the requirement for a computer to do the same.\n      3. **I expect AI will have a huge impact on science and technology.** However I'm skeptical of the existing models of AI R&D, which fit curves to human R&D and try to extrapolate from that.\n\n##          The Workshops\n\n\nThe Windfall Trust workshop.\n\n: This workshop asked participants to discuss four possible future scenarios. Each scenario had a page-long description of what might happen, but they can be summarized as follows:\n\n      1. Low capability growth (\"the incremental path\")\n      2. High capability growth without regulation (\"the runaway economy\").\n      3. High capability growth with labor-market regulation to protect jobs (\"the great pushback\")\n      4. High capability growth with redistribution (\"the post-work society\")\n\n![Windfall Trust Workshop](images/2025-09-25-05-16-22.png){.column-margin}\n\nThe NBER workshop.\n: The NBER workshop was a set of papers on .\n\n![NBER workshop](images/2025-09-29-09-44-20.png){.column-margin}\n\n##          General Observations\n\nMy view: we are driving in fog.\n\n: I think it's reasonable to have high uncertainty: (1) it's possible that AI will get very good soon; (2) it's difficult to anticipate what will happen if it does.\n\n      We are driving in fog: it's possible we have miles of open road, it's possible we're about to hit a tree. It seems sensible to be prepared for either outcome. \n\nMany AI researchers expect mass unemployment.\n\n: There's a standard set of ideas which have been circulating in AI circles for the past decade. This is an important context for the discussion at both workshops.\n\n    1. AI will soon be able to replicate most human labor.\n    2. There will be mass unemployment.\n    3. AI firms should fund a universal basic income. \n\n    Academic economists have tended to bristle at each of these points:\n   \n      1. Economists are generally skeptics about AI progress, or have been until recently.\n      2. Economists argue (i) there are many frictions which prevent rapid changes; (ii) even if computers were better at everything than humans, there's still comparative advantage; (iii) new technology will create new tasks for humans.\n\n\nMany economists avoided talking about transformative AI.\n\n: Both workshops were intended explicitly for discussion of a hypothetical: what would happen *if* AI capabilities keep increasing?\n\n      Most of the economists resisted the hypothetical. If you look at the NBER papers about half are effectively discussing the effects of AI with 2024-level capabilities, not the effects of transformative AI.\n      \n      Why? People gave a few different reasons: (1) they were doubtful that AI would improve very quickly; (2) they thought it's more important to work on the economics of actually existing AI; (3) they thought the economics of superhuman AI was formally less interesting; (4) they thought it was important, but were nervous about being perceived as overly credulous by their colleagues.\n\nThe field still seems a little inchoate.\n\n: It seems to me that the field of economics-of-AI is still pretty open:\n\n      1. There is no standard way of modelling AI in economics (more on this below).\n\n      2. There is no commonly accepted definition of Artificial General Intelligence, or Superintelligence, or Transformative AI.\n\n      3. There are relatively few canonical models in the economics of AI. The closest are perhaps: (1) the task-based model of automation, in which capital is used to perform human tasks (@zeira1998workers/@acemoglu2018race); (2) the @aghion2019artificial model of automation's effect on economic growth.\n\n      @brynjolfsson2025agenda is a \"research agenda for the economics of transformative AI\": it's striking that it lists many good questions but cites relatively few papers, and the papers it does cite are generally treated as only conjectures.\n      \n<!-- could say no general papers -->\n\nDefining AI capabilities is surprisingly hard.\n\n: It would be very useful to have a standard terminology for levels of AI capabilities. It would allow us to split our arguments into two parts: (1) when will AGI arrive? (2) what will happen when it gets here? We suffer from not being able to make this distinction. It is very often difficult to tell how much our disagreements about the impact of AI are due to disagreement about capabilities progress vs disagreement about the impact of that progress.\n\n      Conceptually the solution is simple but practically it's hard. Many people have tried to define a set of capability levels but none have been widely adopted: most capability definitions are either too ambiguous or too narrow.[^levels]\n\n      [^levels]: In 2024 Bloomberg [reported on](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/15/openai-chatgpt-reasoning-ai-levels) an OpenAI project to define five levels of AI capabilities (I worked a little on this). Also in 2024 Google Deep Mind released a [5-level framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02462), based on the percentile of human ability (level 2 means 50th percentile of skilled human).\n\n      Here are some examples of definitions that are too ambiguous: (1) it can pass a Turing test; (2) it can do \"most economically valuable labor\"; (3) it can exhibit PhD-level intelligence; (4) it can do the job of a customer service worker. Each of these covers a very broad a range of interpretations, including some such that 2024-level models could already do this.\n      \n      Here are some examples of definitions that are too precise: (1) it can solve ARC-AGI, (2) it can write a paper that passes peer review at NeurIPS, (3) it can earn $1M. These are relatively unambiguous but it's also easy to imagine cases where a model passes these tests while it still has limited economic value.\n\n      I think of this as a problem that is unsolved but which likely does have a solution. It seems plausible that someone will propose a crisp definition that is both unambiguous and general, and we'll all see in retrospect that it makes sense.\n\n<!-- As of today, my preferred definition of capabilities: (1) ;. -->\n\n\nI don't think people appreciate the speed of AI improvement.\n\n: Speakers at the NBER workshop gave various examples of things the models still couldn't do: (1) [solve ARC-AGI puzzles](https://arcprize.org/arc-agi); (2) [extrapolate world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06952); (3) [operate vending machines](https://www.anthropic.com/research/project-vend-1). These are all reasonable examples of limitations as of September 2025, but we should at the same time mention the rate of change. It seems very likely that the primary examples of tasks that AI *cannot* do in 2025 will turn into tasks that AI can do in 2026 (the same was true in 2024 and 2023).\n\n      Some general observations about the rate of progress:\n   \n      1. _ARC-AGI is falling quickly._ LLM scores on ARC-AGI-1 went from around 10% to 80% over a year, and scores on ARC-AGI-2 went from around 3% to 30% over a few months. It's true that a large part of the performance improvement was due to writing wrappers, but the models can write their own wrappers, so it seems likely they'll be able to solve the class of problems which can be addressed by an LLM plus wrapper.\n      2. _Benchmarks are falling rapidly._ It typically takes around 18 months for a newly introduced benchmark performance to go from 25% to 75%. We are frantically making up new tests to map out the limits of machine intelligence.\n      3. _Consumer utility is growing dramatically._ People far prefer answers from newer chatbots to older chatbots. The Elo score of models on chatbot arena is growing at around 150 points/year. This implies about a 70% win-rate, and equivalent to the difference in skill between the top-rated chess player in the world and the player ranked 100.[^winRate]\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![ChatbotArena Elo scores over time](images/2025-09-27-06-12-58.png){.column-margin}\n   From [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/@llms/lmsys-chatbot-arena-leader-over-time).\n:::\n\nThe AI pessimism has mostly evaporated.\n\n: Over summer 2024 many economists predicted that AI would have small economic impacts:\n\n      - Daron Acemoglu predicted AI would cause 0.06% incremental productivity growth over the next 10 years.\n      - Josh Gans said [\"I don’t think it will boost growth appreciably\"](https://x.com/joshgans/status/1812492809326276786) over the next 10 years.\n      - Robert Gordon [predicted small effects](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/conference/2024/AMEC%20US%20Productivity/Sessiontrue3_Gordon_LGAtrueNYFedtrueFuturetrueoftrueLP_240216).\n      - Paul Romer [predicted small effects](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nobel-laureate-paul-romer-sees-093000071.html).\n  \n      I have heard much less of this kind of talk in 2025.\n\n   [^winRate]: It likely be impossible to approach a 100% win-rate, because (1) a fraction of people give noisy answers; (2) some easy queries have a unique correct answer; (3) some queries are ambiguous, meaning different people who ask the same query will have different preferences, and so no answer could ever get 100% of the responses.\n\nEconomists have been modeling diffusion but diffusion is not important.\n\n: Two quantitative forecasts of AI's GDP impact are @acemoglu2024simple (0.06%/year) and @aghion2024ai (1%/year). Both of those papers model AI's future economic impact as primarily a *diffusion* process: they treat the arrival of AI as a one-time shock like electricity or the steam engine which is gradually adopted.\n\n      I think this a bad assumption, AI's capabilities are getting dramatically better over time.\n\n      We could decompose the growth in LLM adoption over a given period into (i) quality growth; (ii) diffusion. It's very difficult to separate these, but I think it's a reasonable guess that growth over the last 12 months (Sept 2024 to Sept 2025) is about 1/2 diffusion of existing capabilities, and 1/2 the causal effect of new capabilities (precisely: growth would've been half as large if models had been frozen in Sept 2024). If this is true then a forecast which was just based on the diffusion of existing capabilities would have dramatically under-estimated the impact of AI, and the gap would become larger as the horizon got longer.\n\n      Of course it is more difficult to forecast a process with both diffusion and quality growth, but I think we need to try.\n\n\n\nGDP will miss a lot.\n\n: There are two reasons why focussing just on GDP will miss important effects:\n\n      1. **AI will change relative prices.** It seems likely that AI will lower the price of services (especially digital services) much more than the price of goods. If we just talk about the effect of AI on output overall, without distinguishing across domains, I think we will miss a lot.\n      \n      2. **AI services won't show up in GDP.** AI is already providing a great deal of value (there are 700M ChatGPT users), but the value won't show up in GDP by our normal accounting methods. In fact it's plausible that AI reduces GDP because it reduces demand for expertise: I no longer call my garage-door-repair guy, because ChatGPT tells me how to fix the door. Services are generally accounted for in GDP just by the wages paid to service-providers. If people substitute from human service-providers towards AI then measured GDP will fall even though true output has increased.\n\n\nWe avoid asking where our preferences come from.\n\n: This is a more philosophical point. Economists take it as given that it's good for people to get what they want, but we don't talk much about where those wants come from. This silence feels particularly notable when talking about radical AI.\n\n      Economists treat everything as an engineering problem: if we know the shape of preferences, and the shape of the technology, then we can get a sense of tightly one will fit into the other, and whether we should be interfering. Thus we spend a lot of time discussing peoples' preferences: labor vs leisure, goods vs services, in-person vs remote.\n\n      We don't often talk about where those preferences come from. But we do know where they come from: mostly from evolution (we are hard-wired to prefer things that were correlated with survival), and the rest from socialization (we learn to prefer things that we saw our parents prefer).[^labile]\n\n      What does this mean for transformative AI: (1) that the preference-maximizing utopia might not look intuitively like a utopia, e.g. maybe it would be people self-stimulating their pleasure receptors; (2) that people brought up in different ways would choose different utopias, and there's no principled way to choose between them.[^utopia] Different societies have already chosen to use their additional surplus in very different ways: to have more children; to devote more time to praising and glorifying god; to have more time at leisure; to consume more goods and services; to live heroically. Once you've been raised with a certain set of values they are somewhat fixed.\n\n<!-- I think this is all tacitly understood: maximizing preference-satisfaction doesn't bear looking into too deeply. But we go on with it anyway. We're like a synod of cardinals, only half-believing the dogma, but thinking it does some good to debate and argue as if it's true. -->\n\n[^labile]: A nice illustration of the strength of learned preferences: Atkin (2015) shows that people who grow up eating rice will go hungry rather than eat wheat, and that people who grow up eating wheat will go hungry rather than eat rice.\n\n[^utopia]: From the Windfall workshop \"post-work society\" scenario: *\"Universities pay people to attend and pursue knowledge among peers; community arts centers; compensate creators; sports leagues provide living wages for participants; childcare receives social recognition and compensation; community gardens and local projects offer meaningful paid work.\"*\n\n<!-- The discourse around AI's windfall has changed.\n\n: Over 2015-2024 there was much discussion about AI causing both surplus and unemployment, and that the surplus could be redistributed to the newly unemployed, e.g. through a UBI. Many of the . -->\n\n<!-- We're removing a wall and we don't know if it's load-bearing.\n\n: We write down precise equilibrium models of the economy but it's generally understood the models only roughly match aggregate statistics, and there are very many puzzles that economists argue over: about growth, the equity premium, lifecycle savings, the equilibrium size of firms, & heterogeneity in productivity. It is easy to exaggerate how accurate these models are at predicting causal effects, and in fact structural models typically underperform black-box models for forecasting. We are now going to make some drastic changes to the production function, and predict how equilibrium will change. -->\n\n\n<!-- ##          Facts about AI today -->\n\n<!-- Chatbot use has exploded.\n\n: Around 1/3 of adults in rich countries are regularly using chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude), and this is the primary economic impact of LLMs.\n\n      This was not obvious a few years ago: many people expected LLMs would have widespread adoption in doing tasks autonomously, without human review, e.g. responding to customer inquiries, data entry, translation. A natural interpretation is that LLMs are not yet reliable enough to operate without human oversight, despite being enormously helpful as advisors.\n\nChatbots are mostly home production.\n\n: The [ChatGPT paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34255) that we released last week showed that 2/3 of queries appear unrelated to paid work, and that the types of queries are very broad. I would broadly characterize them as solving practical problems.\n\n![Distribution of queries from \"How People Use ChatGPT\"](images/2025-09-22-05-32-49.png){.column-margin} -->\n\n##          We don't have a standard model of AI.\n\nEach paper used a different assumption about AI.\n\n: Each of the papers in the NBER workshop used some assumption about how AI changes the production function, but there were many different assumptions. There is no standard way of modelling AI in economics.\n\n      Some of the ways that AI is modelled in economics:\n\n      - Capital can do a wider set of tasks.\n      - Humans can do certain tasks more quickly.\n      - Humans can do a wider range of tasks (e.g. AI spreads expertise).\n\n      In many papers there's no specific assumption on the types of task, just a parameter that reflects the share of tasks affected. In some papers there are more structural assumptions on how tasks are affected, but there are a wide variety of assumptions, e.g. AI gives better predictions, or AI shares information. In some papers there are empirical assumptions, e.g. taking \"AI exposure\" indices across tasks.\n\n      The difficulty of economists n it's a famously difficult problem to give a general terminology or metric for machine intelligence. For 80 years computer scientists and psychologists have been struggling with it.\n\n      I think having a better characterization of machine intelligence is .\n\n      (This is what I'm personally most interested in, and part of the reason why I'm leaving OpenAI and joining METR.)\n\nMany measures of LLM capability are highly correlated.\n\n: As a consequence, AI researchers are comfortable talking just about 'model intelligence' without needing to define what they mean. The correlation of capability is consistent with the idea that LLMs are learning deep latent structures of the world, which are useful across a lot of domains.\n\nWe are making some progress in characterizing AI ability.\n\n: In 2023 and 2024 AI ability was often described in terms of its grades on standardized tests (SAT, GRE, LSAT), by the equivalent years-of-education (Aschenbrenner and OpenAI talked about \"PhD-level intelligence\"). In 2025 METR (@kwa2025longtasks) made a good argument that the most parsimonious model of intelligence is the human-time-length of tasks.\n\n\n##          A Promising Direction: the Statistical Structure of the World\n\nAI's effect on a domain depends on that domain's statistical structure.\n\n: This will be a somewhat vague statement: I'm convinced that the most satisfying explanations of AI's impact across different domains of human life (entertainment, news, hiring, shopping, etc.) will refer to the statistical properties of those domains, e.g. the degree of correlation, the latent dimensionality.\n\n      Put more strongly: the relative effect of a human vs computer brain on a domain will depend on the closeness of the fit between the structure of the brain and the structure of the domain.\n\n<!-- reduced form: the returns to compute, or returns to experience, but there's a structural model -->\n\nSome examples.\n\n:   1. **The concentration of the market for AI depends on the dimensionality of the world.** If the world is intrinsically high-dimensional then the returns to model scale will be steadily increasing, and so we should expect high market concentration. If instead the world is intrinsically low-dimensional then the returns to scale will flatten: many people could train equally good models, and there should be high competition and low markups.\n    1. **The effect of AI on scientific progress depends on the structure of the world.** If the world has a simple latent structure then progress will be more bottlenecked by intelligence than by data, and so we should expect advances in AI to dramatically accelerate scientific progress (argued below).\n    2. **The wages paid to an occupation depends on the work's latent dimensionality.** If the work consists of tasks with high latent dimensionality then the returns to experience and ability will be high, and so wages will be high. As AI changes the incremental effect of human experience and intelligence we should expect it to change the structure of wages.\n    3. **The demand for compute will depend on the self-similarity of the world.** If 7 billion people all have very different problems then there are few efficiencies we can make in inference (through caching and distillation) and the share of GDP paid to compute will be high. If instead they have similar problems then the returns to additional compute will fall rapidly (demand will be inelastic) and the share of income paid to compute will be small.\n    4. **The value of a matching algorithm depends on the dimensionality of preferences.** If the latent structure of preferences is very simple then classic collaborative filtering algorithms will be very efficient, and neural nets will have small additional effects (e.g. suppose preferences over movies can be largely expressed on a single latent dimension). But if preferences are highly idiosyncratic then more advanced AI, and wider data sources, will have big effects on equilibrium.\n\n\n\n<!-- ##          What is the Demand for Labor?\n\nWe're uncertain what residual value labor will have.\n\n: Many discussions ended up coming back to what value human labor will have when computers become super-capable:\n\n      1. What things can only humans do?\n      2. Will people pay a premium for human labor?\n      3. If humans have no advantage, what happens to wages?\n\nWhat things can only humans do?\n\n: Many of the discussions circled around implicit assumptions on what humans can and cannot do.\n\nWill people pay a premium for human labor?\n\n: Suppose a robot  \n\n      1. Robot chef vs real chef.\n      2. People are not willing to pay a significant premium for made-in-US vs made in the rest of the world.\n      3. People are not willing to pay a premium for in-person entertainment and services: employment as musicians, . -->\n\n##          If AI can do everything then wages will fall.\n\nThere's a Ricardian argument that AI will cause wages to increase.\n\n: Suppose computers can do absolutely everything that a human can do, with zero input cost: then humans will just specialize in the things they can do *relatively* better than computers, i.e. their comparative advantage, and this will make wages higher. Pascual Restrepo made this argument, similar arguments are in @caselli2019robot, @smith2024, @trammell2025economic and @korinek2024scenarios.^[@korinek2024scenarios argue that as AI progresses it will causes wages to increase then decrease, but this is a consequence of a specific assumption: that AI will have identical relative productivity across tasks to humans, and so as AI becomes more capable the equilibrium price vector first moves away from, then returns towards, the vector of human productivities.]\n\nThis depends on no scarce resources.\n\n: This reassuring conclusion depends on there being no other scarce inputs which humans and computers compete for. In fact humans do have resource inputs - say 100 square feet and 2000 calories/day. If a computer can do every task at a lower resource cost than a human then there will be no humans employed in equilibrium.[^plentiful] In the hypothetical world this implies that humans who do not own land would starve: the price of their labor, denominated in energy, would fall below subsistence level. \n\n: Among people who are still alive (because they own land, or from charity), would they work? Only if the incremental resource cost of working was below the resource cost of using a computer for that job.\n\n: A thought experiment: suppose we have a stock of A100 chips, then we start introducing more powerful H100 chips. Assume the H100 can do more tasks/hour across all tasks. As we acquire H100s we will keep using A100s for the jobs they are comparatively better for. But once we have sufficiently many H100s we will start to unplug the A100s to make room.\n\nI think scarce resources will bind.\n\n: The argument about scarce resources isn't novel, it's mentioned in all the papers listed above but they all mention it in passing as an additional consideration that might change their conclusions. But I think if we take seriously the hypothetical (that computers can do all work that humans can) then the resource constraints are very real.\n\n[^plentiful]: Assuming computers are in sufficiently plentiful supply that we can ignore every other cost apart from their resource cost. If manufacturing computers requires resources then we could include their amortized manufacturing cost. If we have a scarce supply of computers for other reasons then of course this will keep human wages high.\n\n\n\nI found it useful to have a concrete scenario in which AI can do everything humans can do.\n\n: **TL;DR: everything but land will become dirt cheap, and those who do not own land will have to live off others' charity.**\n   \n      1. Assume that every service and every good can be produced by AI. The inputs are just land, energy, and raw materials. We will also assume there is no intrinsic demand for human labor.\n      2. You can now buy any good at all, price is not a relevant constraint, you just have to choose which object you like and find room for it (you can shop on Amazon with unlimited credit). You can also get any service at the highest possible quality (medical, massage, education, entertainment), price is no longer a constraint, only time.\n      3. However there will still be some scarce resources. For simplicity I'll say it's just land (minerals and energy too, but minerals are in land, and energy production requires land and minerals).\n      4. Suppose we flip a switch and plentiful robots appear, what will happen? People who already own land will be able to exchange slices of it for computer-made goods and services at very favorable rates. Those who do not have land will be stuck: their labor has become worthless, they can not exchange it for anything that requires a resource input. If you are living in a rented apartment your landlord will evict you: you have nothing of value you can offer him in exchange for the use of the land.\n      5. Throughout human history people have been born with an endowment of labor that they could use to exchange for goods and services. This will no longer be true: people can exchange their labor for others' labor, but their labor will no longer have value for land or anything that requires scarce resources.\n      6. Taken literally this implies that people without assets suddenly become entirely dependent on charity. Perhaps the land-rich will collectively redistribute land and resources to the land-poor, and once you have a little land then all other goods and services become close to unlimited.\n      7. Finally we might expect political structure to follow economic structure: if transformative AI causes most workers to lose their economic power, politics may follow.\n\n\nA simple model of labor and land.\n\n: Suppose land and labor are gross complements, that AI is a perfect substitute for labor, and that we have an arbitrarily large quantity of AI. Then the marginal product of labor falls to zero and the entirety of the output will be held by the land-owner. Human labor no longer has any value and workers must live off the charity of the land-owners.\n\n      Formally:\n\n      $$Y=(\\ut{N}{land}^\\rho+{(\\ut{L}{labor}+\\ut{C}{computers})}^{\\rho})^{1/\\rho}$$\n\n      as $C\\rightarrow\\infty$ then the marginal product of labor goes to zero, and all income goes to land.\n\n      Notes:\n\n      - I assumed labor and land are gross complements ($\\varepsilon<1$). If production was Cobb-Douglas then making labor free implies we would get infinite output from a finite amount of land. As long as there is some limit on total output then land and labor must be gross complements beyond some point.\n      - I assumed AI labor is free. We could instead assume AI has some resource cost. In that case the price of labor will be driven down to the input cost of AI labor. The input cost of AI labor could be defined in a few ways but they all appear to me low compared to exiting human wages: the land cost of a GPU is a few square inches, the energy cost is 400 watts.\n      - We could distinguish between two sectors: a sector that requires land (goods) and a sector that requires only labor (services). If we introduce AI as free labor then human wages will retain the same purchasing power for services but their purchasing power for goods will collapse. Concretely: if you try to exchange your labor for goods you will have nothing to offer because the land-holder already has unlimited labor. The model predicts that workers will be not benefit from AI-produced-goods because AI requires land inputs.\n\n\n##          AI scientists will be unlike human scientists\n\nWill efficiency curves start dropping faster?\n\n: A good way of making the AI R&D question very concrete is to look at historical input-efficiency curves across a lot of different areas, and try to predict where they will go in the future. Should we expect them to start dropping faster? Which ones?\n\n: In fact I think these efficiency curves are a very good subject for making forecasts about: both as an output (expressing the practical impact of AI), and as an input (a way of expressing the capability of AI, to then make conditional forecasts with).\n\n![Our World in Data: Technology Costs over Time.](images/2025-09-19-16-49-40.png){.column-margin}\n\nMost models of AI R&D are based on human R&D.\n: Models of AI's impact on technological discovery are typically modelled on human R&D, e.g. (1) AI increases the effective supply of human scientists; or (2) AI automates one component of the R&D process. However both are modelled on a production function fitted on data with human researchers, and it's likely that AI will qualitatively change that production function.\n\nThere's another way to model this.\n\n: My instinct is that there's a different way of modeling this that is more structural. Suppose we have an unobserved landscape, and it can be explored either by a human brain or a computer brain. Humans have been exploring the landscape, finding successively lower local minima, and also finding general patterns in the landscape (e.g. physical laws). We wish to understand how much computers will speed up exploration of the landscape.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Random landscape.** Here there's no structure: every $x$ is an independent random draw.](2025-09-19-transformative-AI-notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Rugged landscape.** This shows a Weiner process (random walk).

This is a well-defined explore-exploit problem, and we can characterize the expected progression of efficiency over time (the decline in $y(.)$ over time) as a function of the statistical structure of the landscape:\n   \n      1. **Random landscape:** If each $y(x)$ is completely independent there's no intelligence needed in choosing $x$ (beyond keeping track of which locations you've already tried). This is just drawing balls from an urn. The growth in efficiency as a function of $N$ draws depends on the distribution of values of $y$  (@muth1986search, @kortum1997research).\n      2. **Rugged landscape:** If $y(x)$ is correlated across $x$ but the correlation is local (e.g. if $y(x)$ is a Weiner process) then the best-estimate of $y(x)$ for a new $x$ will depend only on the neighboring values of $x$. @Callander2011 and @CarnehlSchneider2025 characterize the optimal strategy. Again we are not constrained on intelligence, only on data: the extrapolation algorithm is fairly simple.\n      3. **Regular landscape:** Finally suppose the landscape has some deep latent structure. In this case the best-estimate of $y(x)$ will depend on the entire collection of previously-observed pairs $(x,y)$, and so we *do* expect that predictions could be improved with more intelligence, and so AI should have a big impact.^[The closest paper I know of is @agrawal2019needles.]\n\nImplications of landscape regularity.\n\n: If the world has a regular landscape then we are not primarily constrained on facts, we are constrained on intelligence. Thus if we build a sufficiently powerful pattern-matching machine our progress might accelerate rapidly.\n\n: Random lanscapes, where we'd expect little impact of AI:\n\n     - _Discovering species._ If we are making a list of specific objects (planet) or species (viruses), then the observations cannot be well-predicted from first principles, and we inevitably need new observations. Similarly, if we mapping a genome the exact sequence of base pairs requires individual observations.\n     - _Plant breeding._ Suppose we breed plants just by selecting the highest-yield mutations (and suppose we don't observe anything but how well the plant grows). The statistical problem is trivial, and AI won't help at all.\n\n: Regular landscapes, where we expect a large impact.\n\n      - _Folding proteins._ We are learning a function from a sequence of base-pairs to a 3D shape. The function is high-dimensional but we have reason to expect a low-dimensional representation which would make it tractable - and AlphaFold found one.\n      - _Discovering candidate drugs._\n      \n\nAI R&D has already lead to discontinuities.\n\n: Many fields which have been progressing slowly show a discrete change in the rate of progress when computers took over:\n\n      - Progress in solving optimization problems.\n      - Progress in proving combinatorics theorems (4-color theorem in 1976)\n      - Progress in chess strategy (Elo has fallen quicker since 1997)\n      - Progress in protein folding.\n\n      Some of these have hit provably global minima: the 4-color them; sphere packing; Ramsey numbers; Nash equilibrium of checkers, connect 4, texas holdem, and chess endgames.\n\n      These accelerations have occurred when computer intelligence has surpassed human intelligence for a particular type of pattern-matching. As computer intelligence becomes more general then we should expect more and more lines of progress to start accelerating.\n\nAristotle already had the jigsaw pieces.\n\n: There's a nice analogy for this: did Aristotle already have enough jigsaw pieces for modern science? Was he constrained on facts or intelligence? Suppose we resurrected him, is it enough to explain our theories, or does he also need to see the data we've gathered?\n\n: It seems to me plausible that we could persuade Aristotle of some of the following, just using facts he was already aware of: that the sun is a star, that the earth goes around it, that the whale is not a fish, that the human is a monkey, that force is mass times acceleration, that temperature is motion, that pitch is frequency.\n\n\nPredicting the effect of AI on R&D is *intrinsically* difficult.\n\n: The landscape model I described above implies that we should expect AI to have a big effect when some domain has a latent undiscovered structure. But in many cases this is very difficult to know in advance: we don't know where the floor is. It seems conceivable that there are some very simple undiscovered principles explaining cancer, fluid motion, evolution. But maybe these domains are irreducibly complex.\n\n#          AI as Knowledge Sharing: Higher Welfare, Lower GDP\n\nWhen I get confused about equilibrium effects I think of a village.\n\n: I find it really useful to think of a village of people who exchange their labor according to their pattern of comparative advantage (a programmer, a lawyer, a dentist). We can then ask what will happen to the equilibrium if AI makes some people more productive at some task.[^model]\n\n[^model]: Precise assumptions: suppose each worker has a given level of productivity at each good, and everyone spends the same fixed fraction of their income on each good (i.e. everyone has the same Cobb-Douglas utility function). This is just a standard Ricardian trade model (@wilson1980general). As far as I can tell most labor economics models assume a single \"skill\" dimension with monotone comparative advantage, and don't consider horizontal differentiation (e.g. lawyer vs doctor), but it seems to me this is important for AI's effects.\n\nWhat happens if AI makes people better at programming?\n\n: This model gives nice crisp predictions:\n\n      - If one programmer gets better at programming: that person's wages go up, there is a small harm to other programmers, and a small benefit to other non-programmers.\n      - If all programmers get better at programming by a fixed ratio: the price of programming goes down but the relative wage of programmers stays the same (the benefit accrues mostly to the rest of the economy).\n      - If everybody gets better at programming by a fixed ratio: the price of programming goes down, the relative wage of programmers stays the same (exactly as in the above case).\n      - If low-skill programmers get better at programming: their wages go up, the wages of high-skill programmers go down.\n\n\nIf AI shares knowledge then welfare increases, but GDP falls.\n\n: Suppose differences in productivity are entirely due to knowledge, and suppose AI diminishes that knowledge gap. Intuitively, with ChatGPT in your pocket you now can do the work of a lawyer, a doctor, a carpenter. We can use the differentitated labor model above to get immediate implications. First suppose there are no trade costs:\n   \n      - If the pattern of specialization is symmetric (people have different comparative advantages, but they all earn the same wages) then nothing will change, because you have no reason to switch specialities.\n      - If there are inequalities (some people earn more) then knowledge-sharing will cause migration from low-wage to high-wage occupations, increasing aggregate income but lowering the income of the richest (this is the same as the effect of catch-up technology growth in a trade model.)\n      \n      Next suppose there are some trade costs:\n\n      - GDP will fall, because a flattening of comparative advantage implies it's relatively easier to do services yourself, instead of trading for them.\n\n      Note that trade costs on services are high -- it's much easier to do things for yourself than pay someone else to do it. The average marginal tax rate on labor is probably around 30%, on top of all sorts of other frictions from contracting.\n\n\n\n<!--  Why not New Zealand.\n\n   : At the after-party for the NBER workshop a couple of AI researchers came. The economists felt a bit nervous about saying naive things about AI, and vice versa. One of the AI researchers mentioned he was thinking of using his vest earnings to buy land in Argentina, you know, in case. I was a little dismayed he didn't mention New Zealand.\n\n   \"Optimistic\" is ambiguous.\n\n   : I've learned to avoid saying someone is \"optimistic\" or \"pessimistic\" about AI progress, because it's ambiguous about whether this means they expect it to go fast or slow. \n-->",
