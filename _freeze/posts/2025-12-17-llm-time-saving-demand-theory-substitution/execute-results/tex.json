Should we expect it to be $s\\times(\\beta-1)$, or larger or smaller?\n   \n    How does the answer change if you measure the time-share $s$ before vs after you start using LLMs?\n    \n    If we can observe the time-shares both before and after LLMs, does that help with estimating the overall efficiency gain?\n\nEconomic theory has crisp answers to these questions.\n:  These questions are all equivalent to classic economic questions of how people change expenditure in response to changes in prices. Below I give a cheat sheet, a lookup table, derivations, and some brief survey of different relevant literatures (there are surprisingly many related literatures).\n\nMy guess is that LLMs are mostly substitutes.\n: LLMs let me complete 16 hours of work in an 8 hour day, but the LLM is mostly accelerating me on things that I wouldn't otherwise spend my time on (e.g. fact checking, literature reviews, visualizations), meaning they are substitutes, and so my effective productivity lift is much lower than a doubling of time.\n\n\n##       Cheat Sheet\n\nAssume people spend their time rationally.\n: We will assume people allocate time between sped-up and non-sped-up tasks rationally, trying to maximize their overall output.\n\nThe output gain will be between $\\frac{1}{(1-s)+s/\\beta}$ and $\\beta$.\n: We can put upper and lower bounds on the effect on aggregate output (for a fixed time input):\n      \n      1. If the tasks are perfect substitutes: $\\beta$.\n      2. If the tasks are perfect complements: $\\frac{1}{(1-s)+s/\\beta}$\n      \nThe percent gain is simple in two cases.\n: We can apply the small-change approximation $y'/y \\approx 1 + s(\\beta-1)$ if either of two cases holds:\n\n    1. Most tasks are affected by the speedup ($s\\simeq 1$)\n    2. The productivity increase is small ($\\beta\\simeq 1$) (AKA Hulten's theorem)\n   \n    In these two cases we can estimate the aggregate productivity improvement without knowing the degree of substitutability between tasks.\n    \nIf the time-savings are somewhat small then you can use elasticity of substitution.\n: If you know the elasticity of substitution between sped-up tasks and other tasks, $\\varepsilon$, then we can write an expression for the aggregate increase:\n   $$\\frac{y'}{y} = \\left((1-s) + s\\,\\beta^{\\varepsilon-1}\\right)^{1/(\\varepsilon-1)}$$\n\nIf the time-savings are large, use the area under the demand curve.\n: If the time-savings are large then it's more dangerous to assume a constant elasticity. Instead we ideally want to trace out the entire demand curve (i.e. how time-allocated to a task changes as the efficiency increases), and the speed-up will be proportional to the area under the demand curve.\n   \nUsing pre-LLM shares will under-estimate value for substitutes (and over-estimate for complements).\n: If using the simple $s\\times(\\beta-1)$ estimate, then using pre-LLM shares will under-estimate productivity improvements when tasks are substitutes, while using post-LLM time-shares will over-estimate; the direction flips when tasks are complements.\n\nObserving pre-LLM and post-LLM shares helps.\n: If you observe the time-share both pre-LLM and post-LLM then you can back out the elasticity of substitution, and thus the aggregate efficiency improvement. Graphically, if we observe the change in budget constraint, and change in consumption point, we can infer substitutability, and therefore aggregate productivity improvement.\n\n##          Applications\n\nEstimating productivity improvements from query-level time-savings.\n: @anthropic2025estimatingproductivitygains samples a range of tasks from Claude chatbot logs and estimates the time required for each task both with and without AI assistance.\n\n    My understanding of their calculation:\n    \n    1. Claude is used for around 25% of tasks, $s=0.25$ (pre-LLM distribution of tasks).\n    2. When Claude is used, time-required falls by 80%, $\\beta=5$.\n    3. Therefore the total time-saving is around 20% (using the fixed-share calculation $s(1-1/\\beta)$ with these numbers; this is the small-change/Hulten-style approximation).\n    \n    However as we discussed above, Hulten's theorem only applies for *small* efficiency changes, but these are large changes (80%), so this conclusion requires assuming Cobb-Douglas substitution, i.e. that time-shares are constant.\n\n    **==my guess: people are doing tasks they wouldn't otherwise do.==**\n\nEstimating time-savings in an RCT.\n: @becker2025uplift report an RCT, where software engineers first choose tasks, then get assigned to either with-AI or without-AI conditions. In this case the subjects mostly were *not* using AI, but in follow-up studies they *will* be using AI. This makes it hard to think about interpreting uplift studies over time, insofar as AI causes them to change the task distribution. It would be nice to have a good clear language here.\n\n\n##          Lookup Tables\n\n**Output increase using *ex-ante* time shares**\n\n|                                                      | 1.1X speedup on 50% | 2X speedup on 10% | 5X speedup on 10% |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |\n| $\\varepsilon=0$ (perfect complements/Amdahl)         | 4.8%              | 5.3%              | 8.7%              |\n| $\\varepsilon=1/2$ (complements)                      | 4.8%              | 6.1%              | 12.0%             |\n| $\\varepsilon=1$ (Cobb-Douglas/Hulten)                | 4.9%              | 7.2%              | 17.5%             |\n| $\\varepsilon=2$ (substitutes)                        | 5.0%              | 10.0%             | 40.0%             |\n| $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow\\infty$ (perfect substitutes) | 10.0%             | 100.0%            | 400.0%            |\n\n**Output increase using *ex-post* time shares:**\n\n|                                                      | 1.1X speedup on 50% | 2X speedup on 10% | 5X speedup on 10% |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |\n| $\\varepsilon=0$ (perfect complements/Amdahl)         | 5.0%              | 10.0%             | 40.0%             |\n| $\\varepsilon=1/2$ (complements)                      | 4.9%              | 8.5%              | 26.2%             |\n| $\\varepsilon=1$ (Cobb-Douglas/Hulten)                | 4.9%              | 7.2%              | 17.5%             |\n| $\\varepsilon=2$ (substitutes)                        | 4.8%              | 5.3%              | 8.7%              |\n| $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow\\infty$ (perfect substitutes) | N/A               | N/A               | N/A               |\n\nHow these are calculated:\n:   - **\"X% saving\"** means task-2 productivity increases so that time-per-unit falls by factor $(1-X)$, i.e., $\\beta = 1/(1-X)$. So 10% saving → $\\beta = 1.11$; 50% saving → $\\beta = 2$; 80% saving → $\\beta = 5$.\n    - **\"Y% of work\"** means the time share on task 2 is $s = Y$.\n    - **Output gain** from the CES formula: \n$$\\frac{y'}{y} = \\left((1-s_0) + s_0\\,\\beta^{\\varepsilon-1}\\right)^{1/(\\varepsilon-1)}$$\nwhere $s_0$ is the *ex-ante* share. The reported numbers are $(y'/y-1)\\times 100\\%$.\n    - **Table 1:** The column header specifies the ex-ante share $s_0$ directly. Compute the output gain and report the percent increase.\n    - **Table 2:** The column header specifies the ex-post share $s_1$. First back out the implied ex-ante share using: $$\\frac{s_0}{1-s_0} = \\frac{s_1}{1-s_1} \\cdot \\beta^{1-\\varepsilon}$$ Then compute the true output gain using $s_0$.\n    - **Perfect substitutes (Table 2):** After any productivity improvement, you reallocate entirely to the better task, so the ex-post share is always 100%. Specifying it as 10% or 50% is inconsistent with optimization—hence N/A.\n\n##          Other Points\n\n\nAn analogy: we're turning lead into gold.\n: Suppose I invent a technology to turn lead into gold, so that the price of gold falls by 99%. I'd like to quantify my welfare increase in terms of equivalent income. I could apply a simple share-weighted price-change rule in two ways:\n\n    1. If I use *ex ante* expenditure the effect looks small: my expenditure share on gold is ~0%, so even a 100% price decrease has a negligible effect on my effective income.\n\n    2. If I use *ex post* expenditure the effect looks large: if gold is sufficiently cheap then I'll start buying many things which are made of gold. Suppose I now spend 1% of my income on gold, then it looks like the price reduction has doubled my effective income, because at the original price of gold I would've had to have twice as much income to afford my new basket.\n\n    This discrepancy between *ex ante* and *ex post* values arises because of the high substituability between gold and other materials (steel, bronze). However I'm not confident that we would see that elasticity at *current* prices, it would only occur when gold's price gets sufficiently low, meaning that estimating a CES function wouldn't be sufficient to give a good estimate of the value. To get a realistic estimate we need to map elasticities at different prices, i.e. draw the entire demand function.\n\nSensitivity to CES.\n: I give bounds on aggregate time-savings with a CES model below, but I'm not sure whether you'd get wider bounds if you relax the CES assumption, e.g. account for second-order effects.\n\nNon-homotheticities.\n: In demand theory there can be significant effects from non-homotheticities.\n\nTasks are fake.\n: (...)\n\n\n\n#      Model\n\nWe set up a two-task CES production problem and derive the optimal time split, the implied output, and the response to productivity changes, with limits for common special cases.\n\n**Practical implications (at a glance)**\n\nLet $s\\equiv t_2^*$ denote the optimal time share on task 2 (and $1-s=t_1^*$). Express all effects as log-changes $\\Delta\\ln y^*=\\ln\\!\\big(y^{*'}/y^*\\big)$ when task-2 productivity moves from $A_2$ to $A_2'=\\beta A_2$. The last column plugs in $s=0.1$ and $\\beta=2$.\n\n| Case                                                 | Output effect ($\\Delta\\ln y^*$)                                         | Intuition                                       | Example $\\Delta\\ln y^*$ ($s=0.1,\\ \\beta=2$) |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| General finite change                                | $\\dfrac{1}{\\varepsilon-1}\\ln\\!\\big((1-s)+s\\,\\beta^{\\varepsilon-1}\\big)$ | CES-weighted average of the shock               | $\\dfrac{1}{\\varepsilon-1}\\ln\\!\\big(0.9+0.1\\times2^{\\varepsilon-1}\\big)$ (depends on $\\varepsilon$) |\n| Perfect substitutes ($\\varepsilon\\rightarrow\\infty$) | $\\ln \\beta$                                                             | All time moves to the better task               | $\\approx 0.69$ |\n| Cobb–Douglas ($\\varepsilon=1$)                       | $s\\,\\ln \\beta$                                                          | Log-linear weighting by the task share          | $\\approx 0.069$ |\n| Perfect complements ($\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$)      | $-\\ln\\!\\big((1-s)+s/\\beta\\big)$                                         | Bottlenecked by the slow task                   | $\\approx 0.051$ |\n| Infinitesimal change (Hulten)                        | $s\\,d\\ln A_2$                                                           | Percent gain equals time share on improved task | $0.1\\times\\ln 2\\approx 0.069$ |\n\n**Setup and parameters**\n\n- Time endowment is $1$; choose $t_1\\in[0,1]$ and $t_2=1-t_1$.\n- Productivities: $A_1>0$ for task $1$, $A_2>0$ for task $2$.\n- Taste weight: $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$ on task $1$.\n- Substitution parameter: $\\varepsilon>0$; take $\\varepsilon\\neq1$ for the algebra and then send $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow1$ for the Cobb–Douglas limit.\n- Output aggregator (CES):\n$$y(t_1,t_2)=\\left(\\alpha(A_1 t_1)^{\\frac{\\varepsilon-1}{\\varepsilon}}+(1-\\alpha)(A_2 t_2)^{\\frac{\\varepsilon-1}{\\varepsilon}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon-1}}.$$\n\n**Assumptions**\n\n1. Feasible set: $t_1\\in[0,1]$, $t_2=1-t_1$.\n2. Parameters satisfy $A_i>0$ and $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$.\n3. Decision problem: choose $t_1$ to maximise $y(t_1,1-t_1)$.\n\n**Proposition 1 (optimal time split).** The interior optimum is\n$$t_1^*=\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right)^{\\varepsilon-1}},\\qquad t_2^*=1-t_1^*.$$\n\n*Proof (explicit)*\n\n1. Write the Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}=y(t_1,t_2)+\\lambda(1-t_1-t_2)$ with $y$ as above.\n2. First-order conditions (interior): $\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial t_1=0$ and $\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial t_2=0$ give\n   $$\\lambda=\\alpha\\,A_1^{\\frac{\\varepsilon-1}{\\varepsilon}}\\,t_1^{-\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}}\\,y^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}}=(1-\\alpha)\\,A_2^{\\frac{\\varepsilon-1}{\\varepsilon}}\\,t_2^{-\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}}\\,y^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}}.$$\n3. Cancel $y^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}}$ and rearrange to obtain $\\frac{t_2}{t_1}=\\left(\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right)^{\\varepsilon-1}$.\n4. Impose $t_1+t_2=1$ and solve for $t_1^*$; set $t_2^*=1-t_1^*$.\n5. The interior solution is valid for $\\varepsilon>0$ with finite $A_i$; only the perfect-substitutes limit $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow\\infty$ or $A_i\\rightarrow0$ forces a corner.\n\n**Proposition 2 (indirect output).** At $t_1^*,t_2^*$ the output is\n$$y^*=\\Big(\\alpha^{\\varepsilon}A_1^{\\varepsilon-1}+(1-\\alpha)^{\\varepsilon}A_2^{\\varepsilon-1}\\Big)^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon-1}}.$$\n\n*Proof (explicit)*\n\n1. Substitute $t_1^*,t_2^*$ from Proposition 1 into $y(t_1,t_2)$.\n2. Factor out $\\alpha^{\\varepsilon}A_1^{\\varepsilon-1}+(1-\\alpha)^{\\varepsilon}A_2^{\\varepsilon-1}$ inside the braces; the exponent $\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon-1}$ collapses to the stated form.\n\n**Proposition 3 (infinitesimal productivity change).** Holding $A_1$ fixed, a small change in $A_2$ satisfies\n$$\\frac{dy^*}{y^*}=t_2^*\\,\\frac{dA_2}{A_2}.$$\n\n*Proof (explicit)*\n\n1. Take $\\log y^*=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon-1}\\log\\big(\\alpha^{\\varepsilon}A_1^{\\varepsilon-1}+(1-\\alpha)^{\\varepsilon}A_2^{\\varepsilon-1}\\big)$.\n2. Differentiate with respect to $\\log A_2$:\n   $$\\frac{dy^*}{y^*}=\\frac{(1-\\alpha)^{\\varepsilon}A_2^{\\varepsilon-1}}{\\alpha^{\\varepsilon}A_1^{\\varepsilon-1}+(1-\\alpha)^{\\varepsilon}A_2^{\\varepsilon-1}}\\cdot\\frac{dA_2}{A_2}.$$\n3. The fraction equals $t_2^*$ from Proposition 1, so the result follows.\n\n**Proposition 4 (finite productivity change on task 2).** If $A_2'=\\beta A_2$ with $\\beta>0$, then\n$$\\frac{y^{*'}}{y^*}=\\left(t_1^*+(1-t_1^*)\\beta^{\\varepsilon-1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon-1}}.$$\n\n*Proof (explicit)*\n\n1. Replace $A_2$ by $\\beta A_2$ in $y^*$ from Proposition 2:\n   $$y^{*'}=\\Big(\\alpha^{\\varepsilon}A_1^{\\varepsilon-1}+(1-\\alpha)^{\\varepsilon}(\\beta A_2)^{\\varepsilon-1}\\Big)^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon-1}}.$$\n2. Factor out the old level $y^*$ to form a ratio; the remaining weights inside the braces are $t_1^*$ and $t_2^*=1-t_1^*$, giving the stated expression.\n\n**Proposition 5 (canonical limits).** Take limits of Proposition 4:\n\n- Cobb–Douglas ($\\varepsilon\\rightarrow1$): $\\frac{y^{*'}}{y^*}\\rightarrow \\beta^{1-\\alpha}$ and $t_i^*$ is unchanged.\n- Perfect complements ($\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$): $\\frac{y^{*'}}{y^*}\\rightarrow \\frac{1}{t_1^*+t_2^*/\\beta}$.\n- Perfect substitutes ($\\varepsilon\\rightarrow\\infty$): $\\frac{y^{*'}}{y^*}\\rightarrow \\beta$ with $t_2^*\\rightarrow1$ if $\\beta A_2>A_1$.\n\n*Proof sketch* For $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow1$ apply L’Hôpital to the CES form. For $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow0$ the CES aggregator converges to $\\min\\{A_1 t_1,A_2 t_2\\}$. For $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow\\infty$ it converges to $\\max\\{A_1 t_1,A_2 t_2\\}$. Substitute these limits into Proposition 4 and simplify.\n\n\n#     Related Theory\n\nI don't consider myself an expert on these literatures, take this survey at your own risk.\n\nThe index numbers problem.\n: There's a very old literature on calculating an aggregate price index in a way that accounts for substitutability between different goods. The same theory can be applied to change in goods-prices or task-productivities, see @caves1982indexnumbers.\n: - The Laspeyres index uses base-period weights, and will understate gains when a shock makes you reallocate toward the lower-price good.\n: - The Paasche index uses end-period weights, and will overstate gains when a shock makes you reallocate toward the lower-price good.\n: - A Divisia index is a path integral of share-weighted growth rates. Discrete indices (e.g., Fisher/Törnqvist) are designed to approximate that integral.\n\nConsumer surplus / welfare for large “price” (time-cost) changes\n: The classic consumer surplus measure from a price change is the area under the demand curve, however this measures the Marshallian consumer surplus, which will approximate the welfare-relevant Hicksian surplus only when there are negligible income effects. @willig1976consumerssurplus gives approximation bounds.\n: This literature distinguishes between Equivalent Variation (EV), the change in income that would have the same welfare effect as the price change, and Compensating Variation (CV), the change in income which could *accompany* the price change and restore your utility.\n: @hausman1981exact shows how to compute exact welfare measures (EV/CV, deadweight loss) from an estimated demand curve by imposing integrability (i.e., that the demand actually comes from some underlying utility/expenditure function). @deaton1980aids provides a standard integrable demand system (AIDS) that flexibly captures income and substitution patterns.\n\nEconomics of time allocation (time is a scarce input with shadow prices)\n: @deserpa1971time is a classic reference on time allocation, and time-saving innovations as relaxing the budget constraint.\n\nTask substitution and computerization as task-specific technology shocks\n: @autor2003skill gives the modern “tasks” approach: computerization substitutes for routine tasks and complements non-routine tasks, shifting task content within occupations and generating distributional consequences (e.g., polarization). You cannot summarize tech change as “labor-augmenting” in the aggregate.\n: @acemoglu2011handbook synthesizes and formalizes this task-based view. A central message is that the impact of a task-specific productivity shock depends on: (i) which tasks are affected, (ii) how substitutable tasks are, and (iii) how the economy re-optimizes task assignment across workers/technologies.\n\nHulten’s theorem and when first-order share-weighting breaks\n: @hulten1978growth shows (in a competitive, CRS setting with intermediates) that a *small* productivity shock’s effect on aggregate productivity can be summarized by share-weighted sectoral TFP growth (Domar/revenue-share weights). The key takeaway is the legitimacy of first-order share weighting—but only locally.\n: @baqaee2019macro shows that in production networks, micro shocks can have macro consequences and nonlinearities/higher-order terms matter.\n: @baqaeeBurstein2021incomeeffects and @cominLashkariMestieri2021structuralchange take into account income effects.\n\nAmdahl’s law as the perfect-complements benchmark\n: Amdahl’s law in computer science says the speedup from improving one component is bounded by the unimproved fraction. This corresponds to the perfect-complements case.\n\n<!-- \n   Reallocation and aggregation across units (Olley–Pakes)\n   : @olley1996telecom shows that aggregate productivity can be decomposed into: (i) the unweighted mean productivity across firms (“within”), plus (ii) a covariance between productivity and market share (“between” / reallocation). Their empirical contribution is that changes in aggregate productivity can come as much from reallocating activity toward more productive firms as from within-firm improvements.\n-->\n\n\n\n#      Illustrations\n\n\n##      Indifference Curve\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Budget constraint and optimal allocations under different elasticities](2025-12-17-llm-time-saving-demand-theory-substitution_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##    Demand Curve\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Demand curves with different price elasticities](2025-12-17-llm-time-saving-demand-theory-substitution_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n",
