This seems to have had big effects on social behaviour, mental health, and politics. However radical changes to communication are not unprecedented, we should be able to learn something from the changes accompanying the invention of the alphabet, the printing press, newspaper, telegram, telephone, radio, television, cellphone, & email. \n\n**Instead of building up a body of evidence I will do the opposite.** I will begin with a block of raw conjecture and whittle it down. I feel the academic approach to studying social media is often far too conservative, refusing to give any opinion about the majority of the consequential issues. At the end of the note I will go into more detail about my complaints.\n\n**A diagnosis.** \n\n   - _Politics: a narrow ridge._ I will start with a stupidly simple model of politics: democracies walk on a narrow ridge between authoritarianism and anarchy. Social media, by increasing the variety of political speech, shifts us farther from authoritarianism but closer to anarchy. Thus the political effect of social media depends on which side of the ridge that a state is more in danger of falling into.\n\n      We can crudely split political philosophers into those who have have worried about not enough speech because they perceive a danger from authoritarianism (Madison, Mill, Popper, Chomsky), and those who have worried about too much speech because they perceive a danger from anarchy (Plato, Lippman, Strauss, Huntington). \n\n      Thus we can summarize social media's effect by (1) how far it shifts us from authoritarian toward the anarchic pole, and (2) which danger is greater in a given society.\n   \n      To make precise the danger from anarchy there are a few historical periods where the public discourse was disordered and which arguably led to unecessary conflict and chaos: (1) in 1848 across Europe; (2) in Weimar Germany; (3) in 1968 across Western countries; (4) in various Latin American countries during post-war populist surges. I think the concern about social media disrupting political equilibrium should focus on this type of historical precedent.\n\n   - _Social Interactions._\n   \n   - _Entertainment._ Social media means that people have cheap entertainment on tap. Historically people have struggled with managing their own consumption, e.g. alcohol, opium, food, tobacco, television.\n\n**A plan for making things better.** I think there are a number of feasible ways we could make social media better, feasible in the sense that there are clear historical precedents of using concerted argument and effort to bring about substantial changes. My plan is to change the behaviour of five groups:\n\n   1. _Employees at platforms._ Encourage a sense of professional responsibility and a sharing of knowledge on how to manage a healthy community and how to assess the quality of content.\n   2. _Owners of platforms._ Encourage owners to use their social conscience to bias their platforms towards healthy content, away from unhealthy content.\n   3. _Activist groups._ Help activist groups exert pressure on platforms to bias towards healthy content. Practically this often has been effective by pressuring advertisers, who in turn pressure platforms.\n   4. _The community._ Change norms in social media use, e.g. (1) not to harass people, (2) not to make hyperbolic or exaggerated claims, (3) to restrict the social media use of children.\n   5. _Government and regulators._ Force platforms to publicly report detailed samples of the content that they are showing.\n\n#                             Summary Table\n\nThis table summarizes some basic empirical facts about social media. I put an asterisk ( * ) next to entries where I am *not* aware of a good reference, specifically a reference which discusses the balance of evidence.

Most countries have a single dominant messaging app, i.e. there is limited multi-homing. However most countries have many broadcast apps which are differentiated by the graph: whether clustered by friends, family, neighborhood, industry, or shared interest.\n   \n**Reach-engagement relationship.** For social apps time-spent is roughly linear in reach (consistent with Metcalfe's law), while for non-social apps it's closer to flat.\n\n**Dynamics.** Social network markets tend to be dominated by the first mover, and are rarely replaced. Most change is between-cohort, not within-cohort.\n\n**Causal.**\n\n   - _What determines demand for social media?_ Extremely high dimensional but want simple first-order approximations. Simplest model has `p` as share of population active (\"reach\"), and equilibrium where `p=f(p)`. This gives you extensive and intensive margin, tipping point, network multiplier. Then can add extra parameters for richer models: speed of adjustment, degree of substitutability. (We know demand is 100% network effects but need to figure out how steeply they diminish in different directions (friends/family/geographically/interest-based), and how they interact with quality.)\n\n   - _Business model and content quality_ How big are Spence distortions: (1) ad-funded means optimizing for marginal minute insetad of inframarginal minute (AKA maximizing quantity of time-spent instead of quality of time-spent); (2) network effects means optimizing for marginal user instead of inframarginal user.\n\n   - _How substitutable is social media with other uses of time?_ Hard to estimate substituability separately from network effects; longitudinally seems perhaps 50% of social media growth has been at expense of television.\n\n   - _How big are network multipliers._ Very little clean identification: cluster experiments are almost always under-powered, outages have little external validity. But can estimate from observational distribution.\n\n   - _Causal effect of deprivation._ Many studies on WTA get broadly consistent answers. Few good deprivation studies, results tend to be weak and hard to interpret because of dynamics and network effects. Addictive effects seem real but small (comparable to television or radio?). Observational effects on mental health, esp teens (I haven't been following this literature).\n\n#                             Business Models\n\n<!-- See also: 2022-05-01-twitter-business-models.md -->\n\nSome observations:^[Some references for this table:\n   - [Good reference on 2023 social media pricing](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/27/social-media-apps-adopting-subscription-models/)\n   - [Pornhub mainly ad-supported](https://adent.io/blog/how-does-pornhub-make-money/)\n   - [Telegram ](https://startuptalky.com/telegram-business-model/)\n   - [Story from 2020 about ad-free tiers in newspapers](https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2020/how-premium-ad-free-subscriptions-are-working-in-local-news/)]\n\n1. **Online media is overwhelmingly ad-funded.** This seems to be because: 1) ppl have a general disinclination to pay for services; 2) ad revenue can vary by user (AKA price discrimination); 3) the annoyance of ads is often smaller than the revenue; 4) network effects favor maximizing total users.\n\n2. **Not many platforms allow users to pay to remove the ads.** In part because of adverse selection: the users who would pay are the users who are most valuable to advertisers.\n\n3. **Ad-free services are more common in music and video.** This may be because because (1) the disutility of ads is higher relative to the revenue (i.e. interruptions during music and video are relatively more irritating), (2) network effects are less important when it's passive consumption.\n\n4. **Some ad-supported networks have announced paid features.** I'm skeptical they'll raise much money, and it doesn't make sense to charge for features that increase production, you should give them away: more production will cause more consumption, and so more ad revenue (Tirole).\n\n5. **This discussion leaves out the relationship with creators.** E.g. buying content outright (Netflix) or revenue sharing (Spotify, YouTube, TikTok).\n\n6. **Many paid services started out ad-free but gradually inserted ads.** Cable & Satellite radio, Netflix, HBO Max, Amazon. I cannot think of an example that went in the opposite direction. Intuitively these industries might want to first prioritize adoption, and so offer a low price and high quality, but once they have a secure footprint then they can afford to increase ad-load.\n\n7. **The thing looming on the horizon for all platforms is synthetic content.** It seems likely that very soon platforms will be synthesizing videos which maximize propensity to watch, and ads which maximize propensity to click, and this could replace much hand-made content.\n\n:::{.column-page}\n\n+-------------------------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------+\n|                                     |  social network / dating  |      video / audio      |      news / info      |    messaging    |\n+=====================================+===========================+=========================+=======================+=================+\n| **SINGLE TIER**                     |                           |                         |                       |                 |\n+-------------------------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------+\n| ads    + free                       | -

Perhaps because these are immersive and long experiences, and so it's relatively more disruptive to be interrupted by an ad. In contrast it's not so disruptive (1) to see an ad while reading a story; (2) to see ads between chunks of small content, rather than inserted into one big chunk of content.\n\n3. **Fewer ads if the marginal cost of producing the media is positive.** If you have to pay to produce each unit that's a reason to charge a positive price and not be solely ad-financed. As you increase price you get fewer eyeballs to sell but they're more valuable eyeballs so the advertising loss is small. I'm not sure this explains the absence of ads in comics and in books. \n\n**Anderson & Jullien (2016, Handbook Media Econ) \"The Advertising-Financed Business Model in Two-Sided Media Markets\"** They note that you'd expect ad-financed media to feature duplication and lowest-common-denominator content, while subscription-financed media will get differentiation and niche content.\n\n   > \"marginal ad revenue should equal the reader nuisance cost: if it were lower then total revenue could be increased by decreasing ads and monetizing the subsequent nuisance reduction into the subscription price, and conversely.\"\n\n   > \"The logic above can also explain the coexistence of pay and free services in the same market as a function of platform content. Loosely, media platforms with the highest elasticity of subscription demand would be free while others would have pay-walls. It follows also that those services charging subscription prices would have a lower advertising level than the free services. Using a model of vertical product differentiation, Gabszewicz, Laussel, and Sonnac (2012) show that a free-to-air low quality media platform may coexist with a subscription priced high quality media platform.\"\"\n\n##             Online Advertising [UNFINISHED]\n\n_Incrementality of online advertising._ An advantage of online over offline advertising is that you can observe whether people who saw your advertisement later purchased your product, and use this data to estimate the causal effect of the advertisment on sales. However these estimates are typically too high because those who are exposed to an advertisement likely would have purchased the product anyway.\n\n_Value of offsite tracking._ A number of experiments have compared offsite data to target advertisments increases conversion rates by factor of around 2.^[Wernerfelt et al. (2023)]\n\n_Advertiser elasticity._ The simplest model of advertisers is that they spend on ads up until the point that the marginal cost of a conversion is equal to its marginal value. We can then reason about advertiser choice if we know the ratio between the marginal and average cost of a conversion (i.e. the elasticity of their conversion curve). This can be estimated purely from platform data, i.e. it does not require running experiments on advertisers. Varian (2009) estimates an elasticity in Google Adwords data between 2-3.3, I do not know of other published sources but I think this estimate is a reasonable benchmark.^[Additional remarks: (1) as Varian notes if we know the elasticity we can immediately infer the advertiser surplus from their expenditure on advertising; (2) advertisers tend to be budget-constrained in the short-run but will not be in the long-run; (3) if advertisers have zero marginal costs then their ROAS (return on ad spend) will reveal their elasticity, see this [thread](https://twitter.com/testingham/status/1646162229304213505); (4) this model depends on the marginal value of a conversion being constant, it would break down if the advertiser's lifetime value from a marginal conversion is meanginfully different from the lifetime value of the average conversion (or if they had different incrementality).]\n\n<!-- need to fix this --> \n\n_User ad elasticity._ We are interested in the elasticity of total ad-conversions with respect to consumer ad-load. If elasticity is -1 then ad-load would be profit maximizing (we are at the top of the laffer curve: a 1% increase in ad-load causes a 1% decrease in time-spent, and so no change in total ads shown. Honhold et al. (2015) found that Google's ad-load was to the right of the Laffer curve: by decreasing ad-load they could increase revenue. On contrast Huang et al. (2018) . Also important is the speed of adjustment to changes in ad-load: most studies find fairly small initial impacts, Honhold finds a half-life of 2 month, Huang has a half-life of around 6 months. Also relevant is Yan et al. (2019) but I have not read this paper yet.\n\n- Half life is perhaps 2 months (?).\n- Primary long-run effect of ad-load is on CTR, not on usage of Google (\"for Google search, we did not see changes in the first 3 terms of (2) in Section 2\").\n- Doubling mobile ad-load increases revenue in the short-run but the effect goes to zero after approximately 4 months, \"in reality, the increased ads load is likely long-term negative at the state of the system during the study.\"\n- Halving ad-load lowers revenue in the short-term but increases CTR. \"We estimated that the positive user response would be so great that the long-term revenue change would be a net positive.\"\n- This paper also proposes the CCD (cookie-cookie-day) method of measuring long-run effects.\n\nYan et al. (2019) **[\"Measuring Long-term Impact of Ads on LinkedIn Feed\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03098)**\n\n- *\"Based on the first three months' data, we observe that the long term impact is at a much smaller scale than the short term impact in our application.\"*\n- The PDF isn't on arxiv but available elsewhere.\n\nHuang, Jason, David Reiley, and Nick Riabov (2018) **[Measuring Consumer Sensitivity to Audio Advertising: A Field Experiment on Pandora Internet Radio](http://davidreiley.com/papers/PandoraListenerDemandCurve.pdf)**\n\n- **Headline: long-run elasticity of ad-load on consumption about 1/10, half-life is 6 months.**\n- \"we are able to measure long-run demand effects, with three times as much ad-load  sensitivity  as  we  would  have  obtained  if  we  had  run  a  month-long  experiment.   We  estimate a demand curve that is strikingly linear,  with the number of hours listened decreasing linearly in the number of ads per hour (also known as the price of ad-supported listening).\" -- they also find a positive effect of ad-load on people signing up to the ad-free subscription.\n\n- Vary 3, 4, or 6 interruption per hour; and 1, 1.5 or 2 ads per interruption. Control is 4x1.5. But almost everything is mediated through ad-load.\n\n   | control is 5% ad-load | -25% ad load | +25% ad load |\n   | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |\n   | total listening hours | +1.7%        | -2.8%        |\n   | days active           | +1.7%        | -2.6%        |\n\n\n- **Effects are primarily on the extensive margin:** *\"approximately 18% of the decline in the hours in the final month is due to a decline in the hours per active day, 41% is due to a decline in the days per active listener, and 41% is due to a decline in the number of listeners active at all on Pandora in the final month.\"*\n\n\n\n\n#                             Content [UNFINISHED]\n\n**Prevalence of content.** It seems broadly true that .\n\n| content         | - prevalence of content (by type/time/platform)   | - tradeoff of engagement & prevalence  |\n|                 | - correlation of prevalence w moderation type     | - advertiser sensitivity to prevalence |\n|                 | - legal restrictions on content (by country/year) | - effect of moderation on production   |\n|                 | - platform restrictions (by platform/year)        |                                        |\n\n\n- _Where is the bad stuff?_ For various \"bad\" qualities (spam, misinfo, partisan, toxic, nudity, illegal, violent) how does the prevalence vary with the following: (1) centralized (TV, newspaper, news website) vs decentralized (email, message, social platform); (2) engagement-based ranked vs chronological; (3) follow-based distribution vs propagated distribution (resharing/retweeting) vs recommended distribution (neither follower nor propagated).\n\n- _Who is creating content?_ Probably 50% of all content consumed is user-generated without a clear profit motive. Implies a delicate balance of norms which makes this huge system work. Platforms have tried many creator profit-sharing models, haven't seen much survey of how this works.\n\n**How does the moderation system affect equilibrium content?** There is big variation in moderation systems (ranking, mods, voting, shadowbans, karma) and big variation in outcomes (abuse, toxicity, informational value). It would be incredibly useful to compile observational data and give some stylized facts.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**Q: why is there so much bad content on decentralized media?** How much of the excess due to (A) people want to see bad content, and traditional media doesn't show it to them; (B) bad actors exploit platforms to show users bad content they don't want to see; (C) algorithms have an accidental bias towards bad content; (D) it's just demographic differences.\n\n**Q: why do platforms moderate?** The vast majority of moderation is not legally required, why do they do it? Some mixture of pressure from users, owners, advertisers, regulators, employees. The answer to this seems important. There's a lot of observational variation that could be used to help answer this (though I doubt there are any clean natural experiments you could use as an IV).\n\n#                             Politics [UNFINISHED]\n\n_Association with polarization/populism._ Correlation with growth in polarization (Gentzkow paper), correlation with growth in populist politics (a few papers).\n\n   - Boxell, Gentzkow and Shapiro (2021) [\"Cross-Country Trends in Affective Polarization\"](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26669/w26669.pdf): between 1980 and 2020 US affective polarization went from 25% to 55%. But in other countries mixture of increase and decrease, and no clear correlation with measure of online news consumption.\n\n**TO DO:** Culturally specific ; peer effects ; we could be eating better diet.\n- causal : closer to elite capture va populist capture (narrow corridor) \n\n#                             Welfare [UNFINISHED]\n\n- WTP and consumer surplus from social networks (Gentzkow, Brynjolfsson, etc.)\n- Causal effect of removal (Gentzkow, others?)\n\n- (look at Carl Shapiro notes)\n1. **Q: How deep is the moat from network effects?** How much better does a competitor need to be to steal the customers from incumbent? Appears to be large. Will get coexistence when there is differentiation in graphs.\n\n<!-- 2. **Q: what is the causal effect from exposure?**\n   - *Overall exposure effects must be large:* grow up surrounded by Catholics you become Catholic, grow up surrounded by Protestants you become Protestant. If you measure effect of single Protestant sermon on a Catholic, will get tiny effect. But you know there is a self-reinforcing equilibrium. -->\n\n<!-- \n**notes:**\n\n- stylized fact : populist politics and social media over representation ; also stylized adoption of social media and polarization ; \n- model : one parameter is tipping point ; two parameter speed of adjustment ; three parameter substituability w other networks ; \n- stylized : what fraction of content is profit motivated ; \n- causal : marginal network multiplier (most studies way underpowered); \n- causal : WTA and deprivation causal effect -- addictive effects seem second order (would guess television is similar) ; \n- stylized : what moderation systems contribute to more/less bad content ; \n- causal - teen mental health ; \n- causal : closer to elite capture va populist capture (narrow corridor) \n\n- biggest effect likely through culture . credible that prior shifts in media technology fundamentqlly affected beliefs and desires of populations (alphabet , printing , film. radio, television ) , and social media seems of similar magnitude \n- biggest fact about the world is that beliefs and desires vary very broadly and in a non rational way , not genetic, but cultural ; media must play some role in culture but hard to say ; // culture as willingness to provide for fellow man , and also antipathy ; preference for how many children to have ; for what car to drive ; for who to vote for ; \n- Akerlof and kranton identity economics \n- non economists : tufecki that it changes ability to coordinate (classic exonoxmic explanation); martin guri that it dissolves trust in institutions and power.  -->\n   \n\n#                             Plan for Change\n\nHere is a sketch for how things could be better.\n\n**(1) Platform workers: become more opinionated about quality of content.** I believe many platforms under-appreciate the returns to investment in content quality.\n\n**(2) Platform owners: internalize a social responsibility.** Platforms quietly suppress unhealthy: conspiracies, hyperpartisan, illegal, and quietly raise up healthy content: constructive.\n\n   *Historically:* Ted Turner (CNN), Murdochs (Fox/NewsCorp), Sulzbergers (NYT), Bancroft (WSJ), Grahams (WaPo), Bezos (WaPo).\n\n**(3) Activist groups: pressure platforms over unhealthy content.** Advertisers and activist groups make it unpleasant for platforms to show unhealthy content.\n\n   *Historically:* Mainstream media (radio, TV) has always avoided things that might offend a pressure group, e.g. NAACP, Anti Defamation League/AIPAC, SPUC.\n\n**(4) Society: Norms change for social media use.** Social norms shift against conspiracy theories, partisan cheerleading, bullying, mindless use. Parents restrict their childrens' use.\n\n   *Historically:* Huge variations with respect to diet, smoking, drinking, gambling, drugs, sex, gender, discrimination. The variation generally more than can be explained by prices or incentives in normal sense. It seems that people generally do what they see their peers do.\n\n**(5) Government: Regulated transparency of what's shown.**\n\n   Platforms required to share random samples and the most-popular shared content.\n\n   *Historically:* literature on transparency has sparse causal effects; perhaps transparency on fracking reduced externalities.\n\n#                             Complaints on Economic Research [UNFINISHED]\n\n**Lack of stylized facts.** Extraordinary how many papers spend 100 pages on estimating a specific causal effect, and 1/2 page establishing the basic magnitudes, trends, and correlations in the area under study.\n\n**Most of the papers today are on second-order topics.** We are discussing papers about topics where we either (1) have good identification or (2) an elegant piece of counter-intuitive theory. But of course these two criteria are almost uncorrelated with what's important. We all acknowledge this.\n\n   I think everyone in the room understands this, that we're tacitly operating not entirely in good faith, so we're not misled. However this can confuse outsiders, e.g. regulators and PhD students.\n",
