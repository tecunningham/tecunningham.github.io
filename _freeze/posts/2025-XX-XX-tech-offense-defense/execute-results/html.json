The answer depends on conflict structure, not the technology itself. I identify four mechanisms: (1) finite search with fixing → defense, (2) finite search with monitoring → offense, (3) verification with ground truth → defense, (4) examination without ground truth → offense. The speed of technological change adds a separate offensive advantage. Applications include code vulnerability discovery (defense), AI essay detection (offense), and deepfakes (offense, but provenance systems could flip this).\n:::\n\nWhen a new technology emerges—better AI, faster networks, improved sensors—who benefits more: attackers or defenders?\n\nThe answer depends not on the technology itself, but on the **structure of the conflict**. A tool that helps defense in one setting can help offense in another.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The same technology can favor different sides depending on conflict structure](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI identify four mechanisms that determine which side benefits. Each has distinct logic and clear predictions.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Visual Convention\nThroughout this document: **Blue** = Defense benefits, **Red** = Offense benefits, **Green** = Secure/Protected\n:::\n\n# A Decision Framework\n\nTo determine which side benefits from technology, ask three questions:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Decision tree for predicting which side benefits from improved technology](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe logic:\n\n**Finite search space.**\n: When vulnerabilities are limited, better search eventually exhausts them—favoring defense.\n\n**Fix vs. monitor.**\n: If defense can permanently fix holes, they accumulate protection. If they can only monitor known holes (with limited attention), the attack surface grows faster than defense capacity.\n\n**Ground truth vs. appearance.**\n: If defense can verify against reality (e.g., check a document's actual history), better classifiers help defense. If defense only sees appearances (e.g., does this essay \"look\" authentic?), better classifiers reveal how to optimize forgeries.\n\n# Four Core Mechanisms\n\n##        Mechanism 1: Finite Search Space (Defense Favored)\n\nWhen both sides search for vulnerabilities in a **finite space**, improved search technology favors defense.\n\nThe intuition.\n: Imagine a wall with 100 holes. Attacker and defender both search—one to exploit, one to plug. With weak search, attacker finds 20 holes, defender finds 15, leaving 5 gaps. As search improves, both find more. Eventually all 100 are discovered and plugged. The attacker's advantage vanishes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![As search technology improves in finite space, defense wins](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Example: Code vulnerability discovery.**\n: Fuzzing tools help both sides find bugs. But codebases have finitely many bugs. As fuzzing improves, defenders find and fix them faster than new ones emerge. Google's OSS-Fuzz has found and fixed 10,000+ vulnerabilities. The backlog shrinks.\n\n**Key feature:** Saturation. The search space is bounded.\n\n##        Mechanism 2: Attention Constraints (Offense Favored)\n\nWhen defense cannot fix vulnerabilities but must **monitor** them with limited attention, improved search favors offense.\n\nThe intuition.\n: Imagine a city with many entry points. Defense has limited guards. As search reveals more entry points, defense spreads thinner. The attacker needs only ONE unwatched entry to succeed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![As known attack surface grows, defense attention spreads thinner](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Example: Network intrusion detection.**\n: As networks grow, security teams discover more attack vectors. But personnel are limited—they can't monitor every endpoint. The attack surface expands faster than monitoring capacity.\n\n**Key feature:** Unbounded monitoring burden. Things-to-watch grows faster than watching capacity.\n\n##        Mechanism 3: Verification with Ground Truth (Defense Favored)\n\nWhen defense can **verify** items against ground truth, improved classification favors defense.\n\nThe intuition.\n: You're testing whether a diamond is real. Your device gives a signal: real diamonds give 10, fakes give 0-8. As the device improves, signal separation increases. With perfect testing, no fake passes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Better classifiers with ground truth verification favor defense](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Example: Document authentication.**\n: Banks verify checks against actual account records. Better fraud detection (signature verification, watermark detection) helps defense more, because the bank can verify against ground truth.\n\n**Key feature:** Ground truth access. Defense can check against an objective standard offense cannot replicate.\n\n##        Mechanism 4: Examination without Ground Truth (Offense Favored)\n\nWhen defense only observes **appearances** without ground truth, improved classification can favor offense.\n\nThe intuition.\n: You're detecting whether a student wrote their own essay. Your classifier flags \"AI-like\" patterns. But you can't verify ground truth—whether AI was actually used. As the classifier improves, it reveals which patterns to avoid. AI tools optimize to evade detection. The classifier becomes a training signal for the attacker.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Better classifiers without ground truth can help offense optimize forgeries](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Example: AI essay detection.**\n: Detectors flag \"AI-like\" patterns but can't verify whether AI was used. As detectors improve, they reveal what to avoid. AI tools train on these signals, optimizing evasion. Structurally favors offense.\n\n**Example: Deepfakes.**\n: Video authentication looks for artifacts. But it's checking appearance, not ground truth. Better detection reveals exactly what artifacts to eliminate. Each detector generation trains the next generator generation.\n\n**Key feature:** No ground truth. Defense's classifier reveals how to optimize forgeries.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## The Classifier Paradox\nBetter detection without ground truth creates a **training signal for attackers**. Each improvement in the classifier reveals exactly what features to optimize in the next generation of forgeries. This is why AI essay detection and deepfake detection face a structural disadvantage.\n:::\n\n# The Role of Technology Speed\n\nEven when technology structurally favors one side, the **speed of technological change** matters enormously.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Rapid technological change favors offense (exploitation window grows)](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe logic.\n: **Patching takes time.** Each offensive capability opens an exploitation window before defense adapts. Slow technological change: defense catches up. Rapid change: offense maintains persistent advantage—each new capability arrives before the previous one is defended.\n\nWhy AI is concerning.\n: AI capabilities advance rapidly—new models every few months, new exploits continuously. Even in structurally defensive domains (vulnerability finding), rapid pace means practical offensive advantage.\n\n**Example: Zero-day vulnerabilities.**\n: Gradual fuzzing improvement: security teams patch at a steady pace. Rapid AI-enabled discovery: patching can't keep up. Theoretical defensive advantage (finite vulnerabilities) overwhelmed by practical offensive advantage (rapid advancement).\n\n# Phase Diagram: Effort and Equilibrium\n\nHow does improved technology shift equilibrium behavior?\n\nIn the \"finding holes\" scenario, let $e_A$ and $e_D$ be attacker and defender effort. Attacker wins with probability:\n$$P(\\text{win}) = F(e_A) - F(e_D)$$\nwhere $F$ is the cumulative probability of finding vulnerabilities.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![As search technology improves (shifting F), equilibrium moves](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key insight.**\n: In finite search space, as search improves:\n- Both sides exert *less* effort (search is cheaper)\n- Defense success rate *increases* dramatically\n- The marginal vulnerability becomes harder to find; defense finds it first\n\nStructure matters more than raw capability—equilibrium dynamics determine outcomes.\n\n# Application: Classifying Real-World Cases\n\nApply the framework to real cases:\n\n## Code Vulnerability Discovery\n\n- **Finite search space?** Yes—codebases have finitely many bugs\n- **Can fix?** Yes—patches are permanent\n- **Prediction:** Defense favored (Mechanism 1)\n- **Reality:** OSS-Fuzz found 10,000+ bugs, now fixed. Vulnerability backlog declining. ✓\n\n## Spear Phishing Emails\n\n- **Finite space?** No—unbounded forgery space\n- **Ground truth?** No—only appearance (\"looks legitimate?\")\n- **Prediction:** Offense favored (Mechanism 4)\n- **Reality:** AI generates personalized phishing at scale. Filters flag patterns; attackers adapt. Offense leads. ✓\n\n## AI Essay Detection\n\n- **Finite space?** No—unbounded essay variations\n- **Ground truth?** No—only appearance (\"looks AI-written?\")\n- **Prediction:** Offense favored (Mechanism 4)\n- **Reality:** GPTZero, Turnitin reveal what patterns to avoid. AI tools evade. Detection accuracy declining. ✓\n\n## Content Moderation\n\n- **Finite space?** Effectively yes—finitely many policy evasions\n- **Can fix?** Yes—patterns added to filters permanently\n- **Prediction:** Defense favored (Mechanism 1)\n- **Reality:** Platforms continuously improve. Detection rates rising for policy violations. ✓\n\n## Deepfakes\n\n- **Finite space?** No—unbounded synthetic media\n- **Ground truth?** Partial—provenance systems exist (C2PA) but most verification is appearance-based\n- **Prediction:** Currently offense (Mechanism 4), but provenance could shift to defense\n- **Reality:** Deepfake quality improving faster than detection. Each detector trains better generators. Provenance systems (content credentials) could create ground truth and flip this. ✓\n\n# Summary\n\nTechnology doesn't uniformly help offense or defense—**structure determines outcomes**.\n\n| Mechanism                   | Key Feature           | Critical Question                | Favors      | Examples                     |\n| --------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |\n| Finite search & fixing      | Exhaustible holes     | Can defense permanently fix?     | **Defense** | Code fuzzing                 |\n| Finite search & monitoring  | Limited attention     | Can defense scale monitoring?    | **Offense** | Network intrusion            |\n| Verification (ground truth) | External validation   | Is ground truth available?       | **Defense** | Document authentication      |\n| Examination (appearance)    | No ground truth       | Does improvement reveal signals? | **Offense** | Essay detection, deepfakes   |\n\n**Speed matters:** Rapid technological change creates offensive advantage—each capability arrives before the previous one is defended.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Policy Implications\n- **Defensive domains** (finite search, ground truth) → Accelerate discovery and patching\n- **Offensive domains** (appearance-based) → Invest in provenance systems to create ground truth\n- **All domains** → Consider slowing capability advancement to give defense time to adapt\n\nThe offense-defense balance is not fixed—**it's a design choice** embedded in our institutions and technologies.\n:::\n\n# References\n\n**Garfinkel & Skaperdas (2007)** \"Economics of Conflict: An Overview\"\n: Contest models and conflict economics.
