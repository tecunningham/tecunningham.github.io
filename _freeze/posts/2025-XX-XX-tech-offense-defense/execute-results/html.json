The answer depends critically on the **structure of the conflict**, not just the technology itself.\n\nI present four core mechanisms that determine which side benefits from technological improvement. Each mechanism has distinct logic and leads to different predictions.\n\n# A Decision Framework\n\nTo determine which side benefits from technology, ask three questions:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Decision tree for predicting which side benefits from improved technology](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe logic behind each branch:\n\n**Finite search space.**\n: When there's a limited set of vulnerabilities to find, better search technology helps defense more—because eventually all holes are discovered, and the last one found determines the winner.\n\n**Can fix vs. must monitor.**\n: If defense can permanently fix discovered vulnerabilities, they accumulate protection over time. If they can only monitor known vulnerabilities (with limited attention), attackers benefit as the known vulnerability set grows.\n\n**Ground truth vs. appearance.**\n: If defense can verify items against ground truth (e.g., checking a document's actual history), better classifiers help defense. If defense only sees appearances (e.g., does this essay \"look\" authentic?), better classifiers help offense optimize forgeries.\n\n# Four Core Mechanisms\n\n##        Mechanism 1: Finite Search Space (Defense Favored)\n\nWhen both sides search for vulnerabilities in a **finite space**, improved search technology favors the defender.\n\nThe intuition.\n: Imagine a wall with 100 holes. Both attacker and defender search for holes—attacker to exploit them, defender to plug them. Initially with limited search capability, attacker might find 20 holes and defender finds 15, leaving 5 exploitable gaps. But as search technology improves, both sides find more holes. Eventually all 100 holes are discovered. At that point, every hole is plugged, and the attacker has no advantage left.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![As search technology improves in finite space, defense wins](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Example: Code vulnerability discovery.**\n: Modern fuzzing tools help both attackers and defenders find bugs in code. But since any codebase has a finite number of bugs, as fuzzing improves, defenders find and fix more bugs over time. The vulnerability backlog shrinks, favoring defense.\n\nThe key feature.\n: **Saturation.** The search space is bounded, so improved search eventually exhausts it.\n\n##        Mechanism 2: Attention Constraints (Offense Favored)\n\nWhen defense cannot fix vulnerabilities but must **monitor** them with limited attention, improved search favors the attacker.\n\nThe intuition.\n: Imagine a growing city with many entry points. Defense can watch known entry points but has limited personnel. As search technology reveals more and more entry points, defense must spread their attention thinner across them. Meanwhile, the attacker only needs to find ONE unwatched entry point to succeed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![As known attack surface grows, defense attention spreads thinner](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Example: Network intrusion detection.**\n: As networks grow more complex, security teams discover more potential attack vectors. But security personnel are limited—they can't actively monitor every endpoint. Attackers benefit from the expanding attack surface.\n\nThe key feature.\n: **Unbounded monitoring burden.** The set of things to watch grows faster than the defense's ability to watch them.\n\n##        Mechanism 3: Verification with Ground Truth (Defense Favored)\n\nWhen defense can **verify** items against ground truth, improved classification technology favors the defender.\n\nThe intuition.\n: Suppose you're checking whether a diamond is real. You have a testing device that gives a signal. Real diamonds give signal 10, fake diamonds give signals from 0-8 (with noise). As your testing device improves, it becomes easier to distinguish fakes from genuine items. In the limit of perfect testing, no fake can pass.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Better classifiers with ground truth verification favor defense](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Example: Document authentication.**\n: Banks verify checks by comparing against actual account records. Better fraud detection systems (AI-powered signature verification, watermark detection) make it harder for forgers to succeed, because the bank can ultimately verify against ground truth.\n\nThe key feature.\n: **Ground truth access.** Defense can check against an external, objective standard that offense cannot fully replicate.\n\n##        Mechanism 4: Examination without Ground Truth (Offense Favored)\n\nWhen defense only observes **appearances** without ground truth, improved classification technology can favor the attacker.\n\nThe intuition.\n: Suppose you're detecting whether a student wrote their own essay. You have a classifier that flags \"AI-like\" writing patterns. But \"AI-like\" is about appearance, not ground truth—you can't actually verify whether the student used AI. As the classifier improves, students learn what patterns to avoid. Sophisticated AI tools can optimize text to avoid detection flags while still doing the work. The classifier helps offense optimize forgeries.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Better classifiers without ground truth can help offense optimize forgeries](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Example: AI essay detection.**\n: Essay detectors flag \"AI-like\" patterns, but they can't verify ground truth (whether AI was actually used). As detectors improve, they reveal what patterns to avoid. AI tools are then trained to avoid these patterns, optimizing their forgeries. This is an arms race that structurally favors offense.\n\n**Example: Deepfakes.**\n: Video authentication systems look for artifacts and inconsistencies. But they're checking appearance, not ground truth. As detection improves, it reveals exactly what artifacts deepfake generators need to eliminate. Each generation of detectors trains the next generation of generators.\n\nThe key feature.\n: **No ground truth, only signals.** Defense's improved classifier reveals information that offense can use to optimize forgeries. The classifier becomes a training signal for the attacker.\n\n# The Role of Technology Speed\n\nEven when technology structurally favors one side, the **speed of technological change** matters enormously.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Rapid technological change favors offense (exploitation window grows)](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe logic.\n: **Patching takes time.** When a new offensive capability emerges, there's a window before defense adapts. If technology changes slowly, defense catches up and hardens systems. If technology changes rapidly, offense maintains a persistent advantage—each new capability arrives before the previous one is fully defended.\n\nThis is why AI is particularly concerning.\n: AI capabilities have been advancing rapidly—new model releases every few months, new exploitation techniques discovered continuously. Even in domains where technology structurally favors defense (like vulnerability finding), the rapid pace means offense may maintain an advantage in practice.\n\n**Example: Zero-day vulnerabilities.**\n: When fuzzing tools improve gradually, security teams find and patch vulnerabilities at a steady pace. But when AI enables rapid discovery of novel exploit classes, the patching process can't keep up. The theoretical advantage to defense (finite vulnerability space) is overwhelmed by the practical advantage to offense (rapid capability advancement).\n\n# Phase Diagram: Effort and Equilibrium\n\nWe can visualize how improved technology shifts the equilibrium efforts of attackers and defenders.\n\nConsider the \"finding holes\" scenario. Let $e_A$ be attacker effort and $e_D$ be defender effort. The probability attacker wins is:\n$$P(\\text{win}) = F(e_A) - F(e_D)$$\nwhere $F$ is the cumulative probability of finding vulnerabilities.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![As search technology improves (shifting F), equilibrium moves](2025-XX-XX-tech-offense-defense_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key insight from the phase diagram.**\n: In the finite search space model, as search technology improves:\n- Both sides exert *less* equilibrium effort (because search is cheaper)\n- But defense success rate *increases* dramatically\n- The marginal vulnerability becomes harder to find, and defense finds it first with high probability\n\nThis is why the structure matters more than just \"who benefits from better technology\"—we need to understand the equilibrium dynamics.\n\n# Application: Classifying Real-World Cases\n\nLet's apply the decision framework to classify some important cases:\n\n## Code Vulnerability Discovery\n\n**Is search space finite?** Yes—any codebase has finitely many bugs.\n\n**Can defense fix holes?** Yes—patches can permanently fix vulnerabilities.\n\n**Prediction:** Defense favored (Mechanism 1).\n\n**Reality check:** Fuzzing tools help both sides find bugs. Google's OSS-Fuzz has found 10,000+ bugs in open-source projects, which are then fixed. The backlog of critical vulnerabilities in mature codebases has been declining, consistent with defensive advantage.\n\n## Spear Phishing Emails\n\n**Is search space finite?** No—unbounded space of convincing forgeries.\n\n**Ground truth available?** No—defender only sees appearance (does this email \"look\" legitimate?).\n\n**Prediction:** Offense favored (Mechanism 4).\n\n**Reality check:** AI makes it trivial to generate personalized, convincing phishing emails at scale. Email filters flag suspicious patterns, but attackers quickly adapt. This is an ongoing arms race where offense currently leads.\n\n## AI Essay Detection\n\n**Is search space finite?** No—unbounded space of essay variations.\n\n**Ground truth available?** No—detector only sees appearance (does this \"look\" AI-written?).\n\n**Prediction:** Offense favored (Mechanism 4).\n\n**Reality check:** GPTZero, Turnitin AI detector, and similar tools all face the same problem: as they improve, they reveal exactly what patterns to avoid. AI tools can be trained to evade detection. Detection accuracy has been declining as evasion methods improve.\n\n## Content Moderation (policy-violating content)\n\n**Is search space finite?** Effectively yes—there are finitely many ways to evade content policies.\n\n**Can defense fix holes?** Yes—patterns can be added to filters permanently.\n\n**Prediction:** Defense favored (Mechanism 1).\n\n**Reality check:** Platforms continuously improve content moderation. While new evasion tactics emerge, the overall trend has been toward better detection rates for policy violations. This is consistent with defensive advantage in a finite search space.\n\n## Deepfakes\n\n**Is search space finite?** No—unbounded space of synthetic media.\n\n**Ground truth available?** Partially—some provenance systems exist (C2PA), but most verification is appearance-based.\n\n**Prediction:** Currently offense favored (Mechanism 4), but could shift to defense with widespread provenance standards.\n\n**Reality check:** Deepfake quality is improving faster than detection. Each generation of detectors trains better generators. However, cryptographic provenance systems (content credentials) could shift this to defensive advantage by providing ground truth.\n\n# Summary\n\nTechnology doesn't uniformly help offense or defense—the structure of the conflict determines which side benefits.\n\nFour key mechanisms:\n\n| Mechanism                   | Key Feature              | Technology Favors | Examples                              |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| Finite search & fixing      | Exhaustible vulnerabilities | **Defense**       | Code fuzzing, vulnerability scanning  |\n| Finite search & monitoring  | Limited attention        | **Offense**       | Network intrusion, perimeter security |\n| Verification (ground truth) | External validation      | **Defense**       | Document authentication, watermarking |\n| Examination (appearance)    | No ground truth          | **Offense**       | Essay detection, deepfakes            |\n\nThe speed of technological change creates an additional offensive advantage: rapid advancement prevents defense from catching up, even in structurally defensive domains.\n\n**For policy and strategy:**\n- In defensive domains (finite search, ground truth), invest in accelerating discovery and patching\n- In offensive domains (appearance-based), invest in provenance systems to create ground truth\n- In all domains, consider slowing the pace of capability advancement to allow defense time to adapt\n\nThe offense-defense balance is not fixed—it's a design choice embedded in our institutions and technologies.\n\n# References\n\nKey papers on offense-defense balance and conflict:\n\nGarfinkel & Skaperdas (2007) \"Economics of Conflict: An Overview\"\n: Comprehensive review of contest models and conflict economics.
