I'm pooling together forecasts of growth in GDP, TFP, labor productivity, and welfare. I'm also mixing forecasts for the US, EU, and World. Some forecasts aren't explicitly over a 10 year horizon but I hope I'm not being unfair. Please send me an email if you think I'm misinterpreting one of these.\n\nEconomists and AI people disagree.\n: 1. **Most economists expect 0.1--1.5%/year.** The two exceptions are @baily2023machines and @korinek2024scenarios.\n      1. **Most AI-people expect 3--30%/year.** A notable exception is Andrej Karpathy who recently says he expects GDP growth to remain on historical trends.\n\nThe disagreement is about the AI, not about the economics.\n: I think the primary cause of the disagreement is about the future rate of AI progress, not about (1) the current economic impact of AI; (2) the rate of diffusion & adoption of AI over time; (3) the substitutability between AI-produced and human-produced services.\n\n      In short - most forecasts by economists assume no further progress in AI.\n\n\n#           Observations\n\nMost economists are treating AI as a one-time shock.\n: Consider this table by @filippucci2024miracle which compares assumptions across four different papers which have forecast the future economic impact.\n: ![](images/2025-10-10-08-14-31.png)\n: There are two notable things about this table:\n\n      1. The assumptions are static, they are estimating the economic impact of *existing* AI by referring to studies of uplift (often which use outdated models, e.g. gpt-3.5).\n      2. The papers all assume no effect on \"innovation\" (the bottom row). I.e., they do not consider the effects of AI on existing productivity.\n\n: It is worth emphasizing that many forecasts of AI's impact assume that AI is a one-time change which will slowly diffuse through the economy, i.e. they assume that (1) AI will not get any better than it is today, and (2) AI will not help with productivity growth, e.g. through improving R&D.\n\n    I believe this is true of most forecasts below, including @acemoglu2024simple and @aghion2024ai, however @baily2023machines separately discusses the impact on the long-run growth rate.\n\n    I don't feel these papers put in sufficient work to justify the assumption that AI is a one-time shock. The capabilities of AI have been growing tremendously over the past few years, why should we assume that this growth will stop?\n\n\nIt seems odd to expect high capabilities growth but small economic growth.\n: Tyler Cowen & Andrej Karpathy both predict that AGI is imminent, but also that economic growth will not move by more than 0.5%/year. They give a variety of reasons for expecting limited growth effects, some are static (low substitutability), some are dynamic (slow diffusion, complementary innovation). However I  but I would love to understand the quantitative importance of these factors.\n\n      Suppose it takes 20 years to fully diffuse, and each year we experience 0.5% incremental growth, then the equilibrium impact of human-level intelligence will be a 10% increase in output.[@comin2014technologydiffusion say \"the average adoption lag across all technologies (and countries) is 44 years,\" but since the 1950s it has been 7-18 years.] It's hard for me to imagine human-level AI would only increase output by 10% in equilibrium, when we've already increased output/capita by more than 1000% over the last 100 years.  A prediction that an effectively unlimited supply of cognitive labor (i.e. AGI) would cause an 0.5% annual growth seems to imply either extraordinarily low substitutability or extraordinarily slow diffusion.\n\n\n<!-- inventing AGI would be 10X smaller than industrial revolution, or catch-up growth in East Asia, or post-war European growth ; find episodes of highest economic growth -->\n\n\nThe impact in 2024 was perhaps ≈0.5%.\n: We can estimate the impact of AI on output a few ways:\n      \n      - @bick2025rapid estimates that in late 2024, 1-5% of US working hours are on chatbots. With a variety of assumptions about time saved they get aggregate productivity of 1.1%.^[\"Between 1 and 5% of all work hours are currently assisted by generative AI, and respondents report time savings equivalent to 1.4% of total work hours. ... implies a potential productivity gain of 1.1%.\"]\n      - @collis2025welfare asks chatbot users what they would need to be paid to forego using the app for a month, and the average answer is $100. Multiplying this by 80M users they estimate the total consumer value of chatbots is $97B, which is 0.3% of a $30T US GDP.\n      - @humlum2025large finds chatbot users self-report approximately 3% productivity improvement, but there's no detectable impact on wages or employment.\n   \n\nAI may increase welfare without increasing GDP.\n\n: AI is already providing a great deal of value (there are 800M weekly ChatGPT users), but the value mostly won't show up in GDP by our normal accounting methods. In fact it's plausible that AI reduces GDP because it reduces demand for expertise: I no longer call my garage-door-repair guy, because ChatGPT tells me how to fix the door. Services are generally accounted for in GDP just by the wages paid to service-providers. If people substitute from human service-providers towards AI then measured GDP will fall even though true output has increased. If service-providing firms pass through their cost-savings to customers then their measured contribution to GDP will fall. The same argument applies to much older technologies -- the printing press, the encylopedia, YouTube. I don't believe any of the papers below consider this effect.\n\n\n\nForecasting markets expect modest impacts.\n: Forecasting markets appear to expect relatively flat economic variables over the next 10 years. As of October 2025, Metaculus shows expectations over the next century:\n\n      - [World productivity growth increases smoothly from 3% to 5%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/12663/cagr-gdp-growth-per-capita/).\n      - [Labor force participation falls smoothly from 84% to 36%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/18289/) \n      \n      The changes are large but it takes 100 years, and the transition is relatively smooth. The smoothness is consistent with either (1) shared expectations of smooth growth; (2) shared expectations of discontinuous changes but uncertainty about when; (3) shared expectations of discontinuous growth but disagreement about when (i.e. disagreement between forecasters).\n       \nFinancial markets expect modest impacts.\n: Asset prices do not seem to anticipate dramatic effects from an intelligence explosion, though they are hard to interpret. @chow2024transformative argues that if the markets expect AGI then real interest rates should go very high, for two reasons: (1) if people expect dramatically higher incomes today they will save less and spend more (pushing interest rates up); (2) the returns on AI investments will be very high (pushing interest rates up).\n\nWhat are some historical precedents?\n: 1. \n\n\n<!-- J-curve -->\n\n<!-- add some historical growth ranges -->\n\n#     Forecasts\n\n\n\n| date of forecast | author                                                                                                                                             | annual excess growth,<br /> 2025-2035 | quote                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| March 2023       | @briggs2023potentially (Goldman Sachs)                                                                                                                   |                 +1.5%                 | *\"We estimate that widespread adoption of generative AI could raise overall labor productivity growth by around 1.5pp/year (vs. a recent 1.5% average growth pace), roughly the same-sized boost that followed the emergence of prior transformative technologies like the electric motor and personal computer.”*                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| May 2023         | @baily2023machines                                                                                                                                 |                 +2.8%                 | *\"The projection labeled “Level” assumes that generative AI raises the level of productivity and output by an additional 18% over ten years, as suggested by the illustrative numbers we discussed for the first channel.
