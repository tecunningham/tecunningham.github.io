Some forecasts aren't explicitly over a 10 year horizon but I hope I'm not being unfair. Please send me an email if I'm misinterpreting one of these.\n\nEconomists say 0.1--1.5%.\n: The two exceptions are @baily2023machines and @korinek2024scenarios.\n\nAI people say 3--30%.\n: Forecasts by people involved in AI are between 3% and 30%, with the exception of Andrej Karpathy, who says he expects GDP growth to remain on historical trends.\n\n      There are also some forecasts by AI-involved people which do not mention GDP because they expect dramatic things to happen, e.g. human extinction or post-scarcity, such that GDP is no longer relevant.\n\nForecasters expect modest impacts.\n: Forecasting markets appear to expect relatively flat economic variables over the next 10 years. As of October 2025, Metaculus shows expectations over the next century:\n\n      - [World productivity growth increases smoothly from 3% to 5%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/12663/cagr-gdp-growth-per-capita/).\n      - [Labor force participation falls smoothly from 84% to 36%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/18289/) \n      \n      The changes are large but it takes 100 years, and the transition is relatively smooth. The smoothness is consistent with either (1) shared expectations of smooth growth; (2) shared expectations of discontinuous changes but uncertainty about when; (3) shared expectations of discontinuous growth but disagreement about when (i.e. disagreement between forecasters).\n       \nFinancial markets expect modest impacts.\n: Asset prices do not seem to anticipate dramatic effects from an intelligence explosion, though they are hard to interpret. @chow2024transformative argues that if the markets expect AGI then real interest rates should go very high, for two reasons: (1) if people expect dramatically higher incomes today they will save less and spend more (pushing interest rates up); (2) the returns on AI investments will be very high (pushing interest rates up).\n\nIt seems odd to expect high capabilities growth but small economic growth.\n: Tyler Cowen & Andrej Karpathy both predict that AGI is imminent, but also that economic growth will not move by more than 0.5%/year. This seems somewhat surprising to me, and it's not clear whether this is because they think (1) AGI will have modest long-run effects, or (2) AGI's effects will diffuse very slowly.\n\n      Suppose it takes 20 years to fully diffuse, and each year we experience 0.5% incremental growth, then the equilibrium impact of human-level intelligence will be a 10% increase in output. It's hard for me to imagine human-level AI would only increase output by 10% in equilibrium, when we've already increased output/capita by more than 1000% over the last 100 years. Karpathy and Cowen give a variety of reasons for expecting small effects, some static (low substitutability), some dynamic (slow diffusion), but I would love to understand the relative importance of these factors. A prediction that an effectively unlimited supply of cognitive labor (i.e. AGI) would cause an 0.5% annual growth seems to imply either extraordinarily low substitutability or extraordinarily slow diffusion.\n\n\n<!-- inventing AGI would be 10X smaller than industrial revolution, or catch-up growth in East Asia, or post-war European growth ; find episodes of highest economic growth -->\n\nMany economic forecasts assume AI will stop getting better.\n: It is worth emphasizing that many forecasts of AI's impact assume that AI is a single technology which will slowly diffuse through the economy, i.e. they assume that (1) AI will not get any better than it is today, and (2) AI will not help with productivity growth, e.g. through improving R&D. I believe this is true of both @acemoglu2024simple and @aghion2024ai.\n\n      I don't feel either paper puts in sufficient work to justify these assumptions. The capabilities of AI have been growing tremendously over the past few years, why should we assume that this growth will stop?\n\n\nThe impact in 2024 was probably 0.2-1%.\n: We can estimate in a few ways:\n      \n      - @bick2024rapid estimate productivity impact of LLM chatbots of 0.1-0.9%.^[They estimate 2% of working hours are on chatbots, and they apply a range of estimates on time-savings.]\n      - @collis2025welfare estimate a welfare impact of chatbots worth 0.3% of GDP in the US.^[Chatbot users state a Willingness to Accept of $100/month. Assuming 80M users this means a $98B annual value, which is 0.3% of $30T US GDP.]\n      - @humlum2025large finds chatbot users self-report approximately 3% productivity improvement, but there's no detectable impact on wages or employment.\n\n\nGDP will miss a lot.\n\n: There are two reasons why focussing just on GDP will miss important effects:\n\n      1. **AI will change relative prices.** It seems likely that AI will lower the price of services (especially digital services) much more than the price of goods. If we just talk about the effect of AI on output overall, without distinguishing across domains, I think we will miss a lot. (I talk more about resource prices below).\n      \n      2. **AI services won't show up in GDP.** AI is already providing a great deal of value (there are 700M ChatGPT users), but the value mostly won't show up in GDP by our normal accounting methods.[^wta]. In fact it's plausible that AI reduces GDP because it reduces demand for expertise: I no longer call my garage-door-repair guy, because ChatGPT tells me how to fix the door. Services are generally accounted for in GDP just by the wages paid to service-providers. If people substitute from human service-providers towards AI then measured GDP will fall even though true output has increased. If service-providing firms pass through their cost-savings to customers then their measured contribution to GDP will fall. The same argument applies to much older technologies -- the printing press, the encylopedia, YouTube.[^library] \n\n\n#     Forecasts\n\n\n\n| date of forecast | author                                                                                                                                             | annual excess growth,<br /> 2025-2035 | quote                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| March 2023       | Briggs & Kodnani / Goldman Sachs                                                                                                                   |                 +1.5%                 | *\"We estimate that widespread adoption of generative AI could raise overall labor productivity growth by around 1.5pp/year (vs. a recent 1.5% average growth pace), roughly the same-sized boost that followed the emergence of prior transformative technologies like the electric motor and personal computer.”*                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| May 2023         | @baily2023machines                                                                                                                                 |                 +2.8%                 | *\"The projection labeled “Level” assumes that generative AI raises the level of productivity and output by an additional 18% over ten years, as suggested by the illustrative numbers we discussed for the first channel.
