In these cases the incentives are more likely to be aligned: I can't think of many cases where a sender wishes to be classified as having some good property, but also prefers to not actually have that property.\n- **Selecting with good classifier.** This should eliminate the Goodhart problem.\n\n##          Observations on External Properties\n\n- **Controlling on external properties typically uses metadata.** The primary method for controlling spam is not using content-based classifiers but instead maintaining blacklists of servers: Reiley and Rao (2012) say \"[t]he single most effective weapon in the spam-blocking arsenal turns out to be blacklisting an email server.\" Similarly for misinformation: the most effective measures have not been proactive classifiers (typically low precision, e.g. 10%) or third-party-fact checking (typically high latency). Instead it has been discouragements to posting misinformation, and changes in the overall ranking system.\n- **Cryptographically signing messages.** It still means you must trust *someone*. Digital signing always had limited uptake for email and for SSL on websites: the attention tradeoff implies that it's better if an intermediary does the validation. \n\n##          A model of both\n- There's a set of features 1,...,n, a model can be defined as the number of features that you condition on. We can then characterize three parties with an integer representing the number of features: (1) human, (2) sender, (3) receiver.\n- ground truth is all features - as classifier gets better u get squeezed ; \n- sender has to hide a \"1\" from the classifier , gradually get squeezed ; \n- other adversarial : putting police around town to prevent crime (don't post it publicly), auditing tax returns , applying antibiotics ; (there's some dynamics : try to wipe out population). \n- key is whether sender has a constraint in state space ; but conditional independence won't hold \n- human affairs : jigsaw puzzle it's all there ; vs human things it's all empirical vs theory ;\n\n#           8B\n\n\n[ ] #1: Reduced prevalence may not be enough given scale and contagion effects across platforms. 0.001% error can still lead to significant individual or societal harm depending on the distribution esp. if fundamental sense-making and credibility norms erode\n[ ] Not following the reduced censorship claim of prediction 1\n[ ] Say more about the implications of #5/6 (consolidation opportunity?). Importance of info literacy and contextual info to counter in distinguishable synthetic media. Will industry standards emerge to combat this at the actor- or domain-level?\n[ ] #7: optimistic assumptions around media literacy and not pessimistic enough about the risk of epistemically collapse. Outside democracies with mature and independent press, fake media risks are real and will be exploited to shape information ecosystems, gain power and distortf civic processes. We grossly overestimate the share of the population that engages in media literacy, provenance and fact checking. Podcast comment about being hopeful. Hope is grounded on the mediating role of institutions ie publishers. Leaning on journalistic standards but what if those start waning as the orgs wither and citizen journalism rises. Fact check program have been shown to be rather ineffective.\n[ ] Say more on #8, isn’t plausibility the superpower of LLMs? Counter evidence from SIO already: https://youtu.be/Wbl9XU82Rc8 \n[ ] Specialization is inevitable. There will be fine-tuned models trained to persuade either in general or persuade a subset of the population once sufficient training data is available. Also content persuasiveness is only one small factor in the overall success of an IO. Impersonation and concealing identity are larger factors that this new world enables. \n[ ] Implications of #9: anonymity/ pseudonymity will be increasingly rare and incumbent lock-in (not good for competition or dynamism)\n\n#           Heading 9\n\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/10955/ai-generated-film-ranked-1-in-streaming/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17447/ai-generated-movie-accomplishments/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8403/25-top-100-songs-made-by-ai-by-2050/ -->\n\n\n\n**Each questions asks the probability of significant intentional damage caused with the use of AI.** \n\n**I think a reasonable starting point would be 50% of the historical base-rate of each type of damage.** Assume (1) AI will help attackers and defenders about equally, so total successful attacks will be constant; (2) AI will be used in 50% of successful attacks.

E.g. chess with new rules. \n\n**TO ADD: ambiguous / bistable content.**\n\n**Things will get weird: chimeras:**\n   - [Beast of the sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_(Revelation))\n   - Constant conjunction ; \n   - There will be an earthquake and we will see what’s holding buildings together ",
