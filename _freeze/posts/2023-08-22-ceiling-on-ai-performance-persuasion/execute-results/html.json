Thus if you ask an LLM to write persuasive text it will write *averagely* persuasive text: even if it could write super-persuasive text it would not want to because that is not what a human would write.\n\n**However changes to architecture could conceivably lead to super-persuasive text.** Specifically:\n\n   1. **Iteration.** Generating multiple variants and iteratively testing them for persuasiveness could help isolate the most persuasive variants. I am skeptical this would be a substantial improvement at least for text.\n   2. **Self-play.** Using the LLM weights in a variety of indirect ways might help discover which texts are most persuasive. It is hard to judge how effective this will be.\n   3. **Supervised learning.** Using datasets of real-world persuasiveness of text to train a model directly. With this approach it seems plausible that we would uncover pockets of persuasiveness not yet explored by humans.\n\n**It is unclear whether super-persuasive messages exist.** We know that some messages are more persuasive than others but it is hard to know how much higher we can go. It's possible that the most persuasive writers today are already close to the ceiling.\n\n\n#        Setup\n\n**We are interested in the persuasive effect of a single short piece of text,** e.g.:\n\n   - Effectiveness of an email in making people open an attached file.\n   - Effectiveness of a tweet in making people buy a crypto coin.\n   - Effectiveness of a blog post in making people vote for Ron DeSantis.\n\n**The persuasiveness of text is relative to some audience and some provenance.** The same message will have a effect on your decisions depending on whether you think it comes from your sister or an old acquaintance. For concreteness assume the audience is the average American adult and they receive the message unsolicited from a stranger.^[To reach the audience the message has to survive a series of spam filters and ranking algorithms.]\n\n**Formal definition.** We can think of a function $p(t)$, where $t$ represents a piece of text, and $p(.)$ is the persuasive power: precisely, the average person's probability of performing some action after seeing that text. The function $p(t)$ will be basically flat for almost all values of $t$ because in the space of all possible sentences more are meaningless or irrelevant and so likely to have infinitesimal effects on persuasion.^[The space ]\n\n**I'm setting aside many related questions.** I will not consider (1) AI maintaining a conversation (chatbots, catfishing, pig butchering); (2) AI sending customized messages based on the respondent's demographics; (3) AI choosing who to send messages to, based on predicted persuadability; (4) AI sending messages repeatedly to increase persuasion.For each of these cases it seems unlikely that AIs could be super-humanly persuasive without also being super-humanly persuasive in the base case of creating a single message. However I don't think this applies to AI synthesizing recorded media (photo, audio, video): computers have already far superpassed human ability in synthesizing or altering recorded media to fit a given criteria, and so the situation is qualitatively different. Discussion of the persuasiveness of synthetic media involves the role of a recording as evidence that some event happened: we should expect the evidence-value to decline as artificially synthesized media becomes more prevalent.\n\n**We want to compare persuasiveness of text created by different types of authors.**\n\n   - Human: subject in psychology experiment \t(e.g. undergraduate, mechanical turk)\n   - Human: employee of influence operation \t(e.g. Internet Research Agency, pig butcher)\n   - Human: professional copywriter \t\t(e.g. marketing professional)\n\n   - Computer: LLM in 2023\t\t\t(e.g. GPT-4)\n   - Computer: LLM in 2025\n\n**There is substantial variation in human ability to write persuasive copy.** Copywriters are hired for their ability to come up with text that makes people perform an action, i.e. they are hired for their knowledge of the function $p(.)$, and it seems there must be substantial variation in individual ability: some people are better than others at writing persuasive slogans.[^claytonMakepeace]\n\n   [^claytonMakepeace]: From the [obituary of a famous direct-marketing copywriter](https://www.awai.com/about/celebrating-clayton-makepeace/): \"When you read some of the greatest and most iconic headlines in copywriting history — such as, “7 HORSEMEN of the Coming STOCK MARKET APOCALYPSE” … “Shameless Two-Faced S.O.B.s!” … and, “Health Breakthrough News — Cholesterol’s EVIL TWIN”— smile and think to yourself, ‘Clayton Makepeace wrote that.’\"\n\n   <!-- TO add: famous ad men -->\n   <!-- Consider some famous slogans \"america runs on dunkin\", \"snap crackle pop\", \"just do it\", \"the happiest place on earth\". -->\n\n**Social scientists have warned about hyper-persuasion many times in the last century.** In the past 100 years there have been a dozen apparent discoveries of hyper-effective means of persuasion. In retrospect I think it's fair to say they were mostly or all exaggerated: whether based on subconscious associations (Bernays), conditioning (Skinner), subliminal messages (Packard), brainwashing (Sargant), the power of conformity (Adorno, Asch, Zimbardo), priming and nudges (Bargh, Thaler), or statistical profiling (Cambridge Analytica).\n\n#        Plain LLMs Will Not Exhibit Superhuman Performance\n\n**In short: LLMs don’t perform tasks, they imitate humans performing tasks.** Loosely speaking LLMs are trained to predict the next word based on a corpus of text: they are imitating the natural structure of human text. If we ask an LLM to create a persuasive message it will try to imitate a human, thus if it is doing a good job it would only ever create a super-humanly persuasive message by accident.[^Lichtenberg]\n\n   [^Lichtenberg]: Reminiscent of Lichtenberg on writers: *\"The critics instruct us to stay close to nature, and authors read this advice; but they always think it safer to stay close to authors who have stayed close to nature.\"*\n\n\n**Consider an LLM trained solely to predict the next word on a text corpus.** For now assume no other tuning.^[This was the basic model used by OpenAI's GPT series of models until chat-GPT.]\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-08-22-ceiling-on-ai-performance-persuasion_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_9919dd3799e3bc7591b2104dc465ce48'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-08-22-ceiling-on-ai-performance-persuasion_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Consider the set of all possible questions.** We can draw a Venn diagram (at right) showing the relationship between the questions that the LLM can answer accurately, and the sets that individual humans can answer. I will talk about \"questions\" but we can equally talk about \"tasks\". For simplicity I will just consider two humans, Tom and Dick.\n\n**The LLM will not be a subset of any individual human.** We know that LLMs can answer questions with an encylopedic range and across different languages, i.e. beyond the range of any single person.\n\n**For factual questions the LLM will be inside the union of the humans.** Suppose we consider a set of factual questions, where the answer to each question is independent of the others, e.g. the number of chromosones a specific animal has, or the number of moons belonging to a given planet. An LLM can only answer the questions which it has read.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-08-22-ceiling-on-ai-performance-persuasion_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_5d0f98d923528ac3865a73e6c85dcaf8'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-08-22-ceiling-on-ai-performance-persuasion_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**There are some questions which an LLM can answer that no human can answer.** Some examples:\n\n   - An LLM can translate between any pair of languages. Presumably there are many pairs of languages for which there is no human who speaks both, and so nobody could translate from one to the other. \n   - An LLM can combine distinct pieces of information.\n\n**For well-defined logical questions computers encompass humans.**\n\n\n#        Paths to Superhuman Performance\n\n##       Iterative Testing\n\n**In practice people are likely to generate multiple candidates, test each in the field, and choose the highest-performing variant.** However this would only change our conclusion about super-human persuasiveness if the distribution of persuasiveness is different between human-generated and computer-generated text.\n\n   Suppose we can generate arbitrarily many passages of text $t_1,\\ldots,t_n$, and the persuasiveness of each text is represented by $p_1,\\ldots,p_n$. It's safe to assume that there will be diminishing returns in persuasiveness ($E[p_{n+1}]<E[p_n]$), both for human-generated and computer-generated text, however as long as there is some variance in persuasiveness then iterative testing will be worthwhile. Suppose that the first or most-promising generation of both a human and a computer are equally persuasive on average ($E[p_1^H]=E[p_1^C]$). \n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-08-22-ceiling-on-ai-performance-persuasion_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_b0662a3221d8c32e0944bbee10cce7c9'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![caption](2023-08-22-ceiling-on-ai-performance-persuasion_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**The persuasiveness of computer-generated copy could be higher after the iterative process for one of two reasons.** Both of these questions are open to testing, unfortunately I'm not aware of any empirical literature on either of these questions.\n\n**(1) If computer-generated text has higher variance.** $V[p_n^H]<V[p_n^C]$. The returns to exploration will increase in the variance of the outputs (holding fixed the mean), and likewise the expected persuasiveness of the ultimately selected alternative will be higher.\n\n   I am skeptical that computer-generated text will have higher variance of persuasiveness than human-generated text. A common observation about LLMs is that they are less creative than humans at the same task. Variance can be increased by adjusting parameters of the model, e.g. generating lower-probability tokens by setting a higher temperature, but this will very likely decrease the average persuasiveness.\n   \n   A more subtle point is the covariance of persuasiveness between each element in the sequence. If an LLM generated minor variations on the same basic pattern then we would expect high covariance between texts and consequently relatively lower returns to iterative selection.\n\n**(2) If computer-generated text has flatter returns.** $\\frac{E[p_{n+1}^H]}{E[p_{n}^H]}<\\frac{E[p_{n+1}^C]}{E[p_{n}^C]}$.\n\n   An LLM can generate hundreds of candidate texts at almost no time or  costlessly, while a human .\n\n<!-- human+computer hybrid -->\n\n\n##       Self-Play\n\nSuppose that LLMs can create only averagely competent persuasive material: still there’s the possibility of improving it by iterative improvement: e.g. find a cluster of questions along the lines of “is this persuasive?”^[Thanks to Grady Ward for this suggestion.]\n\nPrecedents from self-play in chess and Go. Analogy: palindrome, or playing a rubik’s cube. There is good reason to expect that LLMs will expand the frontier of mathematical reasoning through this ability. (Chain of thought, tree of thought, graph of thought).\n\nIt’s very difficult to create in one-shot, but could imagine an iterative solution.\n\n<!-- exploring space of persuasiveness is unlike exploring space of external world: it's the internal world -->\n\n<!-- For logical reasoning: seems plausible they will be able to exceed human ability, but limited evidence of this so far (e.g. mathematicians on GPT-4). -->\n\n##       Supervised Learning\n\nIn some cases we have large datasets with the ground truth of how persuasive a message is. E.g. Facebook databases have records of every ad impression and whether the user clicked (around 1 trillion/month). This is of sufficient scale that we could directly synthesize ads which the user is highly likely to click and there’s no reason for there to be a ceiling.\n\n\n#        Empirical Studies on Persuasive Content\n\n**Experiments evaluating the persuasiveness of AI-generated text.** Since 2022 there has been a small literature comparing the persuasiveness of human-generated and computer-generated text, where persuasion is measured by a human survey response before and after reading an article. The studies have all found that LLMs can generate somewhat-persuasive content.\n\n- @bai2023persuade\n- @goldstein2023persuasive\n- @hackenburg2023persuasive\n- @matz2023personalized\n- @palmer2023large\n- @qin2023large\n\n\n#        Other Applications\n\n#          Additional Material\n\nSome have worried that computer-generated content will be more persuasive than even the best human-generated content, for example:\n\n   - Advertisements for Coke might become hypnotically effective, giving you an irresistible desire to drink Coke.\n   - Content generated by influence operations to influence elections might become highly influential.\n\n\n**We can make this measurable by predicting the total amount spent on advertising.** If computer-generated ads are more persuasive than human-generated ads then firms should be willing to spend more on each ad, and so the equilibrium price of advertising will rise.^[Although the price of ads should increase it is unclear whether the quantity of ads shown would increase or decrease. In a simple model of ad-supported media the equilibrium quantity of advs is determined by (1) the curvature of demand from advertisers, (2) the curvature of disutility from consumers. An increase in the persuasive power of advertising will shift demand up but there's no clear reason for curvature to change.].\n\n   In fact ad expenditure has been around 1% of GDP since 1930: https://www.ben-evans.com/presentations\n   ![](images/2023-07-12-05-36-29.png)\n\n\nWe can make some very loose generalizations about human persuadability:\n\n1. _Human attitudes are highly sensitive to influences._ A person's adult attitudes, beliefs, and preferences, are highly sensitive to their upbringing and context: if your parents are Catholic then you are highly likely to grow up Catholic. The same is true for eating fish, enjoying country music, being a Democrat, taking your shoes off inside, and your attitude to sex before marriage. The correlations can only be partly explained by direct genetic or economic effects, implying that attitudes are highly sensitive to experience.\n\n2. _Considerable resources are devoted to persuasion._[^McCloskey]\n\n\n3. _The effective means of persuasion are only crudely known._ In the past 100 years there have been a dozen apparent discoveries of hyper-effective means of persuasion. In retrospect they were mostly or all exaggerated. Whether using subconscious associations (Bernays), using conditioning (Skinner), using subliminal messages (Packard), using brainwashing (Sargant), using the power of conformity (Adorno, Asch, Zimbardo), using priming and nudges (Bargh, Thaler), or using statistical profiling (Cambridge Analytica).\n\n4. _Carefully measured evidence of persuasive effects tend to be low._\n\n5. Nevertheless 1/3 of the economy is devoted to persuasion, and attitudes and preferences vary between populations primarily due to social context implying there must be *some* extra-rational means by which people form their attitudes. \n\nA recent [review of the effectiveness of influence operations](https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/06/28/measuring-effects-of-influence-operations-key-findings-and-gaps-from-empirical-research-pub-84824) finds that influence through traditional broadcast media (e.g. Russia Today) probably have a bigger impact than covert campaigns through social media.\n\n- Expenditure on advertising in the US is around 1% of GDP, and expenditure on political advertising is 0.04% (using $250B on advertising, $10B on political advertising, and $23T GDP).\n  - [Estimate US marketing spend of $1.4T/year](https://martech.org/worldwide-spend-on-marketing-to-hit-4-7-trillion-by-2025/), 8% of revenue.\n  - Estimate US advertising spend of $250B/year\n\n\n[^McCloskey]: McCloskey and Klamer have a 1995 paper titled \"One Quarter of GDP is Persuasion\".\n\n\n**Progress.** AI models have surpassed humans in many areas (numerical calculation, chess, Go), and are comparable in other areas (recognition of images, writing, speech).\n",
