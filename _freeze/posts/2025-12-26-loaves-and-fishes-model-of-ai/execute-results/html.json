Give a village parable to think about AI's economic impact:\n   - Ingredients: someone invents a technology to create fish from rainwater.\n   - Implications: \n      - Some people are made worse off.\n      - Redistribution requires .\n\n2. Back it up with a formal model.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a parable about bread and wine meant to illustrate some of the economic effects of AI. An important point is that I avoid talking about GDP or wages, because AI will have dramatically different effects on different sectors, and so we need to keep track of them.\n\nSuppose there's a village of bakers and winemakers, one day someone discovers a trick to turn water into wine (AI). We can walk through the economic effects:\n\n   1. Wine production is up, bread output is steady.\n   2. The relative price of wine collapses, and so winemakers are made worse off (they can no longer exchange their wine for bread).\n   3. If winemakers can easily convert their wine-presses to grain mills, then they will benefit equally.\n   4. GDP falls, because GDP measures trade, and the bakers no longer need to trade as they're making their own wine.\n   5. The village's tax receipts fall, because tax comes from trade (e.g. income tax).\n   6. If there's trade between villages, then bread-exporting villages are relatively better off, and wine-exporting villages are relatively worse off.\n   7. It's possible to make both bakers and winemakers benefit (a Pareto improvement), but it will require taking bread from the bakers.\n\nI think this is a useful thumbnail for economic effects of AI, letting wine represent the affected industries. For short I'll use \"services\" to mean all the things that AI can do, e.g. software engineering, legal and medical advice, copywriting, editing, and \"goods\" for everything else.\n\nWe can walk through the economic effects:\n\n   1. Service production is up, aggregate output is up.\n   2. The relative price of services collapses, and so service-producers are made worse off (they can no longer exchange their services for goods).\n   3. GDP falls, because GDP measures trade, and the goods-producers no longer need to trade as AI is performing the services.\n   4. Tax receipts fall, because tax comes from trade (e.g. income tax).\n   5. Goods-exporting countries are relatively better off, and service-exporting countries are relatively worse off.\n\n\nSome additional points:\n\n1. We're \n\n\n\nTo add to the parable:\n\n   1.

Concrete memorable names for the two goods/services\n2. Distinct names for the two types of people who create them - e.g. can talk about baker/fisherman separate from bread & fish; thus can talk about a fisherman who bakes bread (perhaps badly).\n3. One is a good, one is a service\n4. Memorable/euphonious names -- great if they're a \n5. An intuitive story about why the cost of production of one of the goods declines, or goes to zero. E.g. someone invents a machine that produces X from rainwater; or someone discloses the secret of producing X so everyone can do it themselves.\n\n- _Bread and wine_ -> good because can say discovery is how to turn water into wine.\n- _Cloth and wine_ -> Ricardo\n- _Bread and circuses_ -> \n- _Loaves and fishes_ -> very memorable; but could be confusing because they're both goods.\n- _Peaches and potatoes_ -> euphonius, but less memorable, and I already have a peach-potato model.\n- _Potatoes and haircuts_ -> you \n- _Potatoes and medicine_ -> \n\n##          goods and services model of AI\n\nHere's a simple model of AI which gives a lot of predictions. Treat the economy as made up of goods and services, and assume that AI makes producing services free, i.e. you no longer require labor input. These things become free: software engineering, legal and medical advice, copywriting, editing.\n\nSome implications:\n\n1. The price of services falls, relative to goods. This means service-producers can purchase fewer goods with their labor, so this makes them worse off, at least in the short run. Their long-run welfare depends on how easily they can shift to goods production.\n\n2. The observed volume of exchange (GDP) will fall, despite the increase in total goods and services production, for two reasons: (A) people are producing their own services, so this doesn't show up in exchange; (B) for most services their GDP value is *imputed* from the cost of inputs, which in turn depends on goods productivity (which hasn't changed).\n\n3. Countries that export services are relatively worse-off, i.e. the terms of trade shift in favor of goods-producing countries.\n\nWe can extend the model in a few ways:\n\n1. Suppose one company controls the production of AI-produced services. The monopoly price.\n\n\n##             formal model\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. Two types of agent, $i\\in\\{A,B\\}$, and two types of good, $j\\in\\{X,Y\\}$, each with a cost of production, e.g. $c_{i,j}$, let $c_{i,i}=c_{j,j}=1$.\n2. Everyone has the same CES utility function, symmetric in each good, and elasticity of substitution $\\varepsilon$ (i.e. the goods are gross complements).\n\nEquilibrium:\n\nEffect of making services free:\n\n1. \n\n2. Representative agent, two goods, the labor-cost of producing services falls. If goods & services are gross complements, then labor will shift to goods-production.\n\n3. Two types of agent, with productivity vectors.\n   - Multiplicative boost to services productivity.\n   - Additive boost to services productivity.\n   - Services are now free for everybody.\n\n##          loaves and fishes model\n\nI find the following a very useful simple way of thinking about the equilibrium effects of AI: \n\nI give a description then a formal model below. Some of the important features: (1) AI will produce dramatic price changes; (2) AI can increase welfare while reducing trade.\n\n\n1. Suppose there's a village with bakers and fishermen, every day they exchange loaves and fishes.\n\n2. Now someone invents a machine that can make fishes from rainwater, & they give the machine away to everybody.\n\n3. Fish output is way up, but the *price* of fishes collapses and fishermen cannot exchange their fish for loaves anymore.\n\n**Implications:**\n\n1. Fishermen will be made worse off in the short-run. Their welfare depends on how quickly they can adapt to start baking bread.\n\n2. Who's getting the surplus? if the fish-making machine is being given away, then the surplus is entirely going to the potato-farmers.\n\n3. Implications for international trade: good news if your country is a peach-importer, bad news if you're a peach-exporter.\n\n4. Redistribution: you have to somehow get the potatoes from the potato-farmers, & give them to the peach farmers. An income tax may not work very well because the potato farmers are now self-sufficient.\n\n**Interpretation.**\n\n- \n\n**Exposure.**\n\n- Existing cross-country analyses.\n- High exposure can be good or bad. I like the IMF Korea framing about complementarity.\n\n**Trade.**\n\n- Conjectures about shifts in terms of trade:\n   - Services become relatively cheaper.\n   - Energy, inputs become relatively more expensive.\n\n**REDISTRIBUTION.**\n\n- Not like redistribution from discovering a gas field, because surplus isn't concentrated.\n- The surplus will be in the peaches.\n\n\n\n## 2025-12-23 |                     peaches-potatoes\n\n i should put out / write up my peaches-potatoes model of AI. When I read what other people are saying, the peaches-potatoes model feels much cleaner.\n\n##               Herbie Bradley conjectures about international trade & AI\n \n https://x.com/herbiebradley/status/2003168574110630292\n\n But he misses out the terms-of-trade effect, and misses out non-market goods.\n\n##                RAND paper on AI & taxation: \n\n“Federal Revenue When AI Replaces Labor: An Examination of Economic Scenarios with Highly Capable Artificial Intelligence” (Carter C.
