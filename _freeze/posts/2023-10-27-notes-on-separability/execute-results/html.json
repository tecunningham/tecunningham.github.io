However over the summer I concluded that any weaker assumptions would get weird behaviour.\n\n**TODO: reconstruct reasoning why nonseparable model is unsatisfactory.**\n:  .\n\n**What are the testable implications of separability?** \n:  1. There's a ton of literature on separability in general.\n   1. The most general condition is non-existence of a set of choices such that each attribute realization appears equally-often on LHS and RHS. Can think of this as cancelling rows in a Motzkin matrix.\n   2. The independence assumption is much more intuitive, but it is only sufficient for binary attributes and $n\\leq 4$.\n   3. Our condition is a bit more complicated than simple separability, it's a type of pairwise separability. Graphical intuition: a set of choices on a cube will violate pairwise separability if projecting the choices onto each face gives a cycle on each face.\n\n**Simplest condition: square cycle.**\n: In the $n=2$ case we have:\n      $$u(x_1,x_2,\\delta)=v(x_1,x_2)+u_x(x_1,\\delta)+u_y(x_2,\\delta).$$   \n   I *believe* the following inequalities will be inconsistent with this:\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      u(x_1,y_1,\\delta) &\\succ u(x_2,y_1,\\delta)\\\\\n      u(x_2,y_2,\\delta) &\\succ u(x_1,y_2,\\delta)\\\\\n      u(x_1,y_2,\\delta') &\\succ u(x_1,y_1,\\delta')\\\\\n      u(x_2,y_1,\\delta') &\\succ u(x_2,y_2,\\delta'),\n   \\end{aligned}\n   $$\n   \n   proof: (unfinished)\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n      v(x_1,y_1) - v(x_2,y_1) + u_x(x_1,\\delta)-u_x(x_2,\\delta) &> 0\\\\\n      v(x_2,y_2) - v(x_1,y_2) + u_x(x_2,\\delta)-u_x(x_1,\\delta)  &> 0\\\\\n      u(x_1,y_1,\\delta') - u(x_1,y_2,\\delta')&> 0\\\\\n      u(x_2,y_2,\\delta') - u(x_2,y_1,\\delta')&> 0,\n   \\end{aligned}\n   $$\n\n\n**There exists a nice intuition for the cancellation condition.**\n: The usual expression of the cancellation condition is fairly abstract: that there cannot exist a set of preferences in which each realization of each attribute appears equally often on left-hand-side and right-hand-side.\n\n   There are some superior ways of explaining this:\n\n   1. **If the preferences are described in relative terms then they contain a cycle.** E.g. suppose we observe these preferences:\n      $$\\binom{north}{west} \\succ \\binom{south}{west},  \\binom{south}{west} \\succ \\binom{north}{east},\n         \\binom{south}{east} \\succ \\binom{south}{west}\n      $$\n      We can write each in a *relative* style as follows:\n      $$North \\succ South,\\ \\ \\ \n         South+West \\succ North+East, \\ \\ \\ \n         East \\succ West\n      $$\n      Alternatively we can avoid the additions and write this as:\n      $$v_{NS} > 0,  \\ \\ \\  v_{WE} > v_{NS},  \\ \\ \\  v_{WE} < 0$$\n\n      We can also apply this to non-binary attributes, e.g. \n         $$\\binom{3 lemons}{2 oranges} > \\binom{2 lemons}{3 oranges}$$\n      Can be rewritten as:\n         $$v(\\text{3rd lemon}) > v(\\text{3rd orange})$$\n\n   2. **.**\n\n##             more notes\n\n**Summary.**\n\n| observations | granularity | attributes | sufficient for additivity                    |\n| ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| incomplete   | -           | -               | cancellation                                 |\n| complete     | continuous  | $n=2$           | hexagon / double cancellation (Wakker, 1989) |\n| complete     | continuous  | $n>2$           | independence                                 |\n| complete     | binary      | $n\\leq 4$       | independence (Bradley et al., 2005)          |\n| complete     | multinomial | -               | cancellation (Tversky, 1964)                 |\n\n\n**For two goods, additively separable if and only if $\\succeq$ satisfies double cancellation.**[^matt]\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n         (x1,y1) \\succ (x2,y2) \\\\\n         (x2,y3) \\succ (x3,y1) \\\\\n         \\implies\n         (x1,y3) \\succ (x3,y2) \\\\\n   \\end{aligned}\n   $$\n\n   [^matt]: Pollison: *\"Debreu (1960) shows that with only two goods ... preferences can be represented by an additively separable utility function if and only if a double cancellation condition holds.\"*\n \n**For *n* goods, additively separable if and only if $\\succeq$ satisfies preferential independence.** From Wikipedia:\n\n   $$(x_1,x_2,\\bm{x}_3)\\succeq (x'_1,x'_2,\\bm{x}_3)\n      \\iff (x_1,x_2,\\bm{x}'_3)\\succeq (x'_1,x'_2,\\bm{x}'_3)\n   $$\n\n**Q: how can it be that additively separable functions are unique only up to linear transforms?** Oh it's simple: any monotonic transform will still represent choice just as well, but that function won't be additively separable. So among the subset of additively separable functions, they're all linear transforms of each other.\n\n**Note: we care about additive separability, not separability.** In our case separability and additive separability are equivalent: Bergstrom theorem 2 shows that if every commodity is separable then they're all additively separable.\n\n**Q: topological vs algebraic approach?** @wakker1988algebraic discusses this: topological essentially is using continuity and first-order conditions, and Debreu assumes continuity for his results. Algebraic is used by Krantz et al., while Wakker's book uses topological.\n\n**What we want: a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite space.**\n\n   - @wakker1989additive has a brief discussion on p33, states a cancellation condition as necessary and sufficient: \"with every $z_j \\in \\Gamma_j$ occurring equally often to the left of the preferences ... as to the right of the preferences\"\n   - He later mentions Dana Scott (1964) who derives something about sets of inequalities but hard to follow.\n\n#                 Conditions\n\n##       Double cancellation / Thomsen\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_44cfa3006a6661dc19f1928f0cd86f92'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![violation of double cancellation](2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=192}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n         (x_1,y_2) \\succ (x_2,y_1),\n         (x_2,y_3) \\succ (x_3,y_2)\n         \\implies\n         (x_1,y_3) \\succ (x_3,y_1)\n   \\end{aligned}\n   $$\n\n   [@wakker1988algebraic, p??] gives the Thomsen condition (for $n=2$) as:\n      $$(x_1,y_2)\\sim (x_2,y_1), (x_2,y_3)\\sim (x_3,y_2)\n         \\implies (x_1,y_3)\\sim (x_3,y_1)$$\n\n   This is essentially double cancellation but with indifferences.\n\n\n##             Hexagon condition\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_8d7ebf01242e1ebd8fc875f0b615baa5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violation of Hexagon condition (Wakker 1989)](2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=192}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@wakker1989additive, this version from @karni1998hexagon, for $n=2$:\n\n   $$(x_1,y_2)\\sim (x_2,y_1),\n      (x_3,y_1)\\sim (x_2,y_2)\\sim (x_1,y_3)\n      \\implies \n      (x_2,y_3)\\sim (x_3,y_2)\n   $$\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_21bb4cdadacf5dd18424e69617ceae32'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example ofrom Fishburn (1970) of choices that satisfy independence (because monotonic), but violate the hexagon condition, and therefore do not have a separable representation.
