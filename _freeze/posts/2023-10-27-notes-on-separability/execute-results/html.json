So among the subset of additively separable functions, they're all linear transforms of each other.\n\n**Note: we care about additive separability, not separability.** In our case separability and additive separability are equivalent: Bergstrom theorem 2 shows that if every commodity is separable then they're all additively separable.\n\n**Q: topological vs algebraic approach?** @wakker1988algebraic discusses this: topological essentially is using continuity and first-order conditions, and Debreu assumes continuity for his results. Algebraic is used by Krantz et al., while Wakker's book uses topological.\n\n**What we want: a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite space.**\n\n   - @wakker1989additive has a brief discussion on p33, states a cancellation condition.\n   - He later mentions Dana Scott (1964) who derives something about sets of inequalities but hard to follow.\n\n\n##                      Conditions\n\n##       Double cancellation / Thomsen\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_e796c3cb52f6f1226fbe9308d388eef2'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![double cancellation](2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=192}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n         (x_1,y_2) \\succ (x_2,y_1),\n         (x_2,y_3) \\succ (x_3,y_2)\n         \\implies\n         (x_1,y_3) \\succ (x_3,y_1)\n   \\end{aligned}\n   $$\n\n   @wakker1988algebraic gives the Thomsen condition (for $n=2$) as:\n      $$(x_1,y_2)\\sim (x_2,y_1), (x_2,y_3)\\sim (x_3,y_2)\n         \\implies (x_1,y_3)\\sim (x_3,y_1)$$\n\n   This is essentially double cancellation but with indifferences.\n\n\n##       Triple cancellation.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_41af29f7c1a69326cd7f25c6e27f0e7e'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![triple cancellation (Reidmeister)](2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=192}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFrom @wakker1988algebraic, says it's for $n=2$:\n   $$(x_1,y_2)\\succeq (x_2,y_1),\n      (x_3,y_2)\\succeq (x_4,y_1),\n      (x_1,y_4)\\succeq(x_2,y_3)\n      \\implies\n      (x3,y4)\\succeq (x4,y3)\n   $$\n   \n   Seems to also be known as \"Reidmeister\" condition.\n\n\n##       Independence\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_8875ae1309b6b9bfbea9a88eacd16fe7'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![triple cancellation (Reidmeister)](2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=192}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n   $$(x_1,y_1,\\bm{z}_1)\\succeq (x_2,y_2,\\bm{z}_1)\n         \\iff (x_1,y_1,\\bm{z}_2)\\succeq (x_2,y_2,\\bm{z}_2)\n      $$\n\n   @wakker1988algebraic calls it \"coordinate independence\" and says \"it is known by many names, such as (preferential) independence, additivity, strong (strict) separability, and the sure-thing principle.\" Wakker writes it like this, which I think is basically equivalent:\n\n   $$(x_1,y_1)\\succeq (x_2,y_1) \\implies (x_1,y_2)\\succeq (x_2,y_2)$$\n\n\n   @karni1998hexagon define independence if *both*:\n   \n   \\begin{aligned}\n      (x_1,y_1)\\succ (x_2,y_1)\n         \\implies (x_1,y_1)\\succ (x_2,y_1) \\\\\n      (x_1,y_1)\\succ (x_1,y_2)\n         \\implies (x_2,y_1)\\succ (x_2,y_2) \\\\\n   \\end{aligned}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_d6d7867f9f8f28698b047925dec0a054'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Hexagon condition (Wakker 1989)](2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=192}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##             Hexagon condition\n\n@wakker1989additive, this from @karni1998hexagon, for $n=2$:\n\n   $$(x_1,y_2)\\sim (x_2,y_1),\n      (x_3,y_1)\\sim (x_2,y_2)\\sim (x_1,y_3)\n      \\implies \n      (x_2,y_3)\\sim (x_3,y_2)$$\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin hash='2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_5622611a8300b191a99f7985d74da123'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example ofrom Fishburn (1970) of choices that satisfy independence (because monotonic), but violate hexagon condition, and therefore do not hae a separable representation.These numbers can be generated by $u(x,y)=xy+x^y$.](2023-10-27-notes-on-separability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=192}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#                 References\n\n**@fishburn1970utility [\"Utility Theory for Decision Making\"](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0708563.pdf)**\n\n   - Chapter 4 \"Additive Utilities with Finite Sets\". Derives cancellation condition from a Theorem of the Alternative, says it has been used for additive utility conditions by @tversky1964additive, Scott (1964), and Adams (1965).\n   - _Separability is not sufficient for additive utility._ Surprising because separability *is* sufficient in continuous spaces (with continuity). I think counterexample is a function that's nonseparable, but you choose a set of discrete points where it's separable. Thus as Wakker says you need to check a lot of cancellation conditions to see if the data fits.\n   - Note: monotonicity is sufficient for separability.\n   - _Counterexample:_  On p43: $u(x1,x2)=x_1x_2+x_1^{y_1}$, with X1={1,2,3}, X2={1,3,5}.

Separability _is_ sufficient for binary dimensions when n<=4.* (however $\\delta$ isn't binary, if we're going to consider that as a dimension)\n   - *Mirror property:* If $\\succ$ is separable then $x\\succ y$ implies $-y\\succ -x$.\n   - *Fishburn pair:* This refers back to Fishburn (1970), they say condition C can be represented as a pair.\n   - They also enumerate all possible preference relations for n=1,2,3,4.\n   - They say at the end they think it's only a *coincidence* that separability implies additivity for n<=4 because there aren't many cases.

He discusses demand but results seems applicable to any multiattribute choice.\n\n- Says that separability is computationally hard but *additive* separability is not computationally hard.\n\n- Regarding general separability (not additive): *\"It is well-known that preferences are separable on X if (x,y)â‰½(x',y) for some y implies (x,y')â‰½(x',y') for all y' ... It is also know that if â‰½ has a utility representation, then preferences are separable on X if and only if there exists some functions v:Xâ†’R and f:RxYâ†’R, where f is increasing in its first argument, such that u(x,y)=f(v(x),y). Assuming differentiability, notice that the marginal rates of substitution between any two commodities in X are independent of the choice from Y.\"*\n\n- I'm confused as to how his result differs from Krantz/Fishburn/Wakker. I don't think they assume concavity. I think perhaps the key difference is that he wants to construct a *continuous* utility function?\n\n**Wikipedia, [Ordinal Utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_utility)**.

Doesn't include proof but refers to Debreu (1960), Fishburn (1970), and Krantz et al. (1971).\n   - Theorem 3: with two commodities utility is additive separability if and only if double cancellation holds: u(x1,y1)>=u()\n\n**@chambers2016revealed \"Revealed Preference\"**\n   \n   - Nothing directly applicable.
