Among dozens of conversations & arguments, here are some things that would keep coming up:\n\n      1. We need more forecasts of economic impacts.\n      2. We need more theory of capabilities.\n      3. We need more metrics of capabilities.\n      4. We need more theory of offense-defense balance.\n      5. We need more bottom-up modelling of capabilities growth.\n\n      I feel bad saying \"we need,\" & scolding others for the work they're not doing, so I've tried to add my own very tentative best guesses about each below.\n\n#       We need more forecasts of economic impacts\n\nWe have few forecasts of the impact of strong AI.\n: A number of people have published explicit forecasts of the future trend of AI capabilities (\"timelines\"), but there are many fewer forecasts of the economic effects of those capabilities, i.e. the effects on GDP, consumption, employment, wages, asset prices.\n\n      The most explicit forecast which allows for strong AI is Epoch's GATE model, see below.\n\n      \n\nHaving explicit forecasts would be very useful.\n: What do we expect AI to do to these things?\n\n      - Wages & employment, across sectors and tenure.\n      - The price of land, the value of the capital stock.\n      - Incomes across different countries.\n\n      I feel it's like early 2020 and COVID: if we're trying to make a decision about whether to announce a lock-down it should be based on a clear idea about the counterfactual, which includes a lot of equilibrium effects.\n\n![Comparison of productivity forecasts from @filippucci2024miracle](images/2025-10-10-08-14-31.png){.column-margin}\n\nMost academic forecasts assume no capabilities growth.\n:   I complained about this in [my previous post](https://tecunningham.github.io/posts/2025-09-19-transformative-AI-notes.html):  @acemoglu2024simple and @aghion2024ai both give explicit forecasts of AI's economic impact (0.06%/year and 1%/year respectively), but both effectively assume that AI will not get any better, they are just extrapolating out from existing capabilities.\n\nI know of just two very concrete economics AGI forecasts.\n: 1. @korinek2024scenarios forecast that, over 15 years, GDP triples; wages increase a little at first, then collapse when everything is automated. GDP continues to increase.\n      1. Epoch's GATE model (@erdil2025gate) forecast full automation in 2034, by which point gross world product (GWP) has grown 10X. They forecast that wages will at first increase dramatically then, at some point after full automation is achieved, collapse.[^others]\n\n\\ \n\n![Metaculus: What will be the prime-age (25-54) labor force participation rate in the United States in these years?](images/2025-10-09-10-35-37.png){.column-margin}\n\nForecasting markets expect big capabilities, small impacts.\n: Forecasting markets expect rapid progress in AI capabilities. As of Oct 2025, the median Metaculus forecasts are:\n\n      - [Weak AGI in 2027](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/)\n      - [Strong AGI in 2033](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence/)\n      - [Transformative AI in 2041](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/19356/transformative-ai-date/)\n\n      However forecasting markets also expect economic variables to remain relatively flat. Over the next 100 years Metaculus expects:.\n\n      - [World productivity growth increases from 3% to 5%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/12663/cagr-gdp-growth-per-capita/).\n      - [Labor force participation falls smoothly from 84% to 36%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/18289/) \n      \n      Both forecasts are relatively smooth over time. The smoothness could be consistent with expecting dramatic effects, but (1) uncertainty about capabilities growth; (2) disagreement among forecasters.\n      \n\n    \nThe financial markets seem to expect small impacts.\n:     Asset prices do not seem to anticipate dramatic effects from an intelligence explosion, though they are hard to interpret.\n\n      @chow2024transformative argues that we should expect real interest rates to increase (and they haven't). @nordhaus2021singularity says that an AI singularity would predict a variety of things, especially an increasing growth rate and increasing capital share, and he says he does not find much evidence for these.\n      \n      <!-- Finally there are explicit financial models produced as inputs for investment decisions, which implicitly contains models of the economic evolution. My sense is these are often fairly crude extrapolations of existing trends, and use heuristic guesses about the total profits that will be generated by AI technology. -->\n\n      Am I missing other forecasts?\n\n[^others]: Tom Davidson has a [2021 report on Explosive Growth](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/could-advanced-ai-drive-explosive-economic-growth/), and a model of [takeoff speeds](https://takeoffspeeds.com)), but I don't think either has a central forecast with multiple aggregate economic variables.\n\n\n<!-- What are my own forecasts?\n: (...) -->\n\nHow can we get more people to forecast?\n: One idea that Anna Yelikazova and I discussed: sponsor a couple of dozen econ grad students to write 5-page very explicit forecasts, and give prizes the most compelling ones.\n\n\n#       We need more theory of capabilities.\n\nWe have many projects which are collecting data on AI impacts.\n\n: We can organize AI impacts into a waterfall, top to bottom:\n\n      1. **Data on AI capabilities** -- benchmarks that have representative tasks across the economy  - e.g. GDP-val (@patwardhan2025gdpval), APEX.\n      2. **Data on AI uplift** -- effect on productivity, e.g. @becker2025uplift.\n      3. **Data on AI adoption** -- adoption by occupations, by industry, by demographic, E.g. @bick2024rapid.\n      4. **Data on AI usage** -- what types of economic tasks are LLMs used for, e.g. @handa2025economicindex, @chatterji2025chatgpt.\n      5. **Data on AI economic effects** -- changes in hiring and wages by occupation, e.g. @brynjolfsson2025canaries.\n\n      Each of these is relatively *unopinionated*, they try to canvas AI impacts in general.\n\nCollecting data is hard without theory.\n\n: I don't think we have that many opinionated *theories* on how each of these should move. Theories are important because we're expecting things to change rapidly, both due to capability growth and adoption growth. If we don't have an explicit theory then we're using an implicit theory.\n\n      Think of spending a lot of time & resources collecting samples of COVID, but not, at the same time, working on a theory of how epidemics evolve and who's more susceptible. \n\nWe don't have many theories of AI's impacts.\n\n: Here are the prominent theories of the *ways* in which AI is likely to be adopted:\n\n      1. **Informal observations about LLMs:** AI researchers generally say that LLMs are relatively better at tasks that are verifiable, short-horizon, low-context, and text-based.\n      2. **Indices of task or occupation \"exposure\" to AI:** @frey2013future, @brynjolfsson2018can, @felten2018method, @webb2019impact, @eloundou2023gpts. METR's time-horizon paper (@kwa2025longtasks) can also be interpreted as an exposure index for tasks.\n\nNathan Lambert seems to feel the same way.\n: Nathan Lambert's post-curve [post](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/thoughts-on-the-curve) says *\"many AI obsessors are more interested in where the technology is going rather than how or what exactly it is going to be.\"*\n\n\n#       We need more metrics of capabilities\n\nWe don't have a standard way of defining AI capabilities.\n: We say \"strong AI\", \"transformative AI\", \"AGI\", or \"ASI\".\n\n      The best concrete metric is probably METR's time horizon index. We can then say \"what happens when AI can do a one month task?\"\n\n      The Forecasting Research Institute is working on a set of well-defined capability scenarios.\n\n![Our World in Data: Technology Costs over Time.](images/2025-09-19-16-49-40.png){.column-margin}\n\nMy favorite metric: frontier cost-efficiency growth.\n: There are hundreds of cost-efficiency metrics that have been regularly increasing over decades: transistor density, corn yield, compression efficiency (see the chart on the right). When AI becomes useful then we expect these metrics to start improving more quickly. Cost-efficiency growth is a useful metric because it's (1) unambiguous; (2) economically relevant; (3) upstream of other economic impacts like employment.\n\n      Existing historical cost-efficiency data:\n\n      - @farmer2016predictable documents progress in 53 technologies (visualized at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/costs-of-66-different-technologies-over-time)), but only up to 2013.\n      - @sherry2021fast document historical trends in algorithmic efficiency across a variety of algorithms.\n\n#       We need more theory of the offense-defense balance\n\n![](images/2025-10-06-11-33-10.png){.column-margin}\n\nMany discussions were about how AI will change the offense-defense balance\n\n: There are dozens of cases where there's some offense-defense balance, and it's no immediately clear how AI will affect that balance. Some examples that came up in the Curve:\n\n      - hacking\n      - ransomware\n      - spearfishing\n      - media manipulation\n      - drone assassinations\n      - drone warfare. \n   \n    In each case it's clear that AI could help both sides, but arguable how the equilibrium will be affected.\n\nWe should have some common theory.\n: It seems wasteful to treat each of these problems independently, there ought to be some general principles we can apply on how AI will affect offense-defense balance.\n\n      The closest I know is @garfinkel2019offensedefense. The argue that when both sides get sufficiently strong then this will generally tend to favor the defender:\n\n      > \"we offer a general formalization of the offense-defense balance in terms of contest success functions. Simple models of ground invasions and cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities suggest that, in both cases, growth in investments will favor offense when investment levels are sufficiently low and favor defense when they are sufficiently high.\"\n\n      I also have a [note from 2023](https://tecunningham.github.io/posts/2023-06-06-effect-of-ai-on-communication.html), which argues that AI will favor the defender for \"internal\" properties (where human judgment is the ground truth), but favor the attacker for \"external\" properties (where external reality is the ground truth).\n\n      This seems an incredibly fertile area for economic theory but I have seen very little enagement from economists.\n\n\n![](images/2025-10-06-11-30-58.png){.column-margin}\n\n#       We need more bottom-up modelling of AI's economic effect [UNFINISHED]\n\nThere are two approaches to modelling AI's effect.\n\n: From a lot of conversations about recursive self-improvement I realized it's useful to distinguish between two qualitatively different ways of thinking about AI's ability to do work:\n\n      1. _Top down:_ AI replaces each of the human subtasks.\n      2. _Bottom-up:_ AI just does the entire procedure from first principles.\n   \n      I think 80% of discussion of economic impacts was of the top-down type.\n\nWhat would bottom-up modelling look like?\n:    There are some papers with \"model organisms\" of recursive self-improvement: Grefenstette (1986) [genetic algorithm to learn parameters for genetic algorithsm](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ITSMC..16..122G/abstract); [AutoML-Zero](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03384) (2020); Schmidhuber (2003) [Godel Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0309048?utm_source=chatgpt.com). \n\nWhat are the implications for recursive self-improvement?\n: AI treats it as a pure optimization problem, already it's better at chip design, algorithm design.\n\n\nSome related discussion:\n: Nathan Lambert recapitulates some discussions from the Curve about recursive self-improvement [here](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/thoughts-on-the-curve).\n\n    This is related to the Bresnahan/systems view of AI. He talks about the first wave of ML models: \"The transition to ICT-based production has largely proceeded at the production system level, not the task level.\"[^bresnahan] \n\n\n[^bresnahan]: \"My empirical conclusion about these applications is that the lazy idea of AI ‚Äì that is, of computer systems that are able to perform productive tasks previously done by humans‚Äì is irrelevant to understanding how these technologies create value. Here‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù does not mean that substitution of machine for human tasks is less important than other determinants of the value in use of AITs. It means irrelevant: task-level substitution of machine for human plays no role in these highly valuable systems.\"\n\n\n   <!-- What metrics should the labs report?\n   : .\n\n   \\ \n\n   My highest compliment to your work is that I didn't read it.\n   : If I start reading your essay and I realize it's really good then I put it aside until I can organize my own thoughts on this question. My thoughts can take a long time to organize. My favorite book, after 20 years, I still haven't made it farther than half-way through. If I tell you I've read your essay it means I liked it but I didn't love it. -->\n\n\n#        References",
