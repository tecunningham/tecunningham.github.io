How is the balance likely to play out?\n\n<!-- For Twitter: \n\nTen tentative predictions about the effect of AI on online communication (spam, misinfo, etc.). I'm working on a much longer writeup so would love to hear arguments or references to good literature. -->\n\n**This note surveys what we know about the likely effect of AI on online communication, summarized with a set of predictions:**\n\n1. **The prevalence of policy-violating content on platforms will decline.** E.g. the prevalence of nudity, hate speech, and harassment, will decline. Classifiers are already approaching human-level performance and so prevalence should approach zero (given the ground truth is human labelling). The same argument applies to automated censorship.\n2. **The prevalence of \"context-specific\" violating content will increase.** This refers to content which appears to be non-violating to the average person but is interpreted in a policy-violating way by its intended audience, or in the specific context where it is posted.\n3. **The prevalence of variations of known-violating content will decrease.** Content that is a match against databases of illegal sexual media (PhotoDNA), IP-protected content (ContentID), or terrorist recruitment content (GIFCT) will become less frequent: obfuscation will become harder as AI models get better.\n4. **Platforms will not be able to identify bots from their behavior.** Behavioral tests like CAPTCHAs will become ineffective against sophisticated actors and so platforms will have to rely relatively more on direct proofs of identity.\n5. **People will not be able to discriminate between real and fake media based only on the content.** Audio and video recordings, since their invention in the 19th century, have been difficult to fake, as a consequence the existence of a recording of an event is strong evidence for that event happening. That will no longer be true.\n6. **Platforms will not be able to discriminate between real and fake media based only on the content.** It is unlikely that AI classifiers will be able to detect AI-manipulated media. This doesn't change the status quo: historically misinformation classifiers which use only features of the content have been very poor.\n7. **Fake media will not have a substantial influence on politics.** Forged documents have circulated for thousands of years but generally with a limited influence on politics because documents have always been evaluted not just on their content but their provenance. Advances in forgery technology seem likely to be accompanied by advances in skepticism.\n8. **Computer-generated content will not be hyper-persuasive.** LLMs are unlikely to allow substantial advances in the ability to manipulate public opinion. Social scientists have warned about \"hyper persuasive\" technologies for a century and been wrong every time.\n9. **Communication will migrate further towards large closed platforms.** The rise of synthetic content will make it harder for individuals to discriminate between reliable and unreliable information sources, and so likely to increase the demand for intermediaries, which implies greater demand for verification and closed platforms.\n10. **Things will get weird.** Our intuitions about meaning and interpretation are based on experience with human-created representations. When computers can generate representations then strange things are likely to happen.\n\n**I also sketch a broader theory of the effect of AI on communication,** making the distinction between \"internal\" and \"external\" properties. I define an \"internal\" property as something that is a function solely of the content: whether an image contains nudity, whether text contains hate speech, whether a joke is funny. AI classifiers are rapidly approaching human-level accuracy for these properties and this means that platforms (and governments) will be able to near-perfectly filter out content that violates their rules, even when content-producers have access to the same technology. An \"external\" property of a message depends on some fact outside the content itself: e.g. whether an image was computer-generated, whether a headline is true, whether a message is from a specific person. Platforms will get better at predicting external properties but they will be outpaced by motivated actors who can manipulate their fakes until they become indistinguishable from genuine articles (and manipulate lies so they're indistinguishable from the truth).\n\nThis note additionally has short appendices on the history of forged documents and on relevant forecasting questions from Metaculus.\n\n**What I don't talk about.** Two big topics that I won't touch on: (1) super-intelligent AI and alignment; (2) social biases in machine learning.\n\n\n#           Predictions\n\n##          Background: computers have become much better at analyzing and synthesizing content\n\nOver the last 50 years computers have been steadily getting better at recognize text and images, with particularly rapid progress since around 2012, so that today computers can out-perform the average humans on many classification tasks. Since around 2018 computers have also become good at *synthesizing* media to match a description, e.g. creating text, images, or video.\n\n![](images/2023-06-16-05-55-29.png)^[Source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/brief-history-of-AI).]\n\n##          The Prevalence of Policy-Violating Content Will Decline\n\nEach of the large internet platforms has a list of prohibited categories, e.g. nudity, obscenity, hate speech, incitement, etc.. Early automated detection systems used lists of prohibited words. Then platforms started training classifiers from human labels. Early classifiers had relatively high precision and recall but made predictable mistakes: they would rely on identifying words and phrases typically used in violating posts which led to [false positives](https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/are-popular-toxicity-models-simply-profanity-detectors) and [false negatives](https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/25-examples-of-twitters-content-moderation-failures). Such classifiers can also be easily tricked by adding some noise, e.g. \"insert typos, change word boundaries or add innocuous words\" ([Gr√∂ndahl et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09115) (2018)). However more recent production models are built on deeper language models and are much more effective at identifying the meaning of posts ([Whitlock Lees et al.](https://research.google/pubs/pub51952/) (2022)).[^employment]\n\nPrevalence of policy-violating content seems to have consistently trended down on most platforms. Meta reports that the prevalence of nudity, bullying, hate speech, and graphic content each declined by a factor of between 2 and 5 between 2017 and 2022, and that the share of identified-violating content that was first identified by an ML model (\"proactive rate\") is approaching 100% for most categories.[^metaDecline]\n\n<!-- precision and recall will change over time endogenously -->\n\n![](./2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png)\n\nOn the other side content producers can use AI models to avoid platforms rules, however they seem to run into diminishing returns. If they had access to the platform's classifier then they could keep testing different variants of a violating post until they found a variant that was not identified as violating. However as the model becomes more accurate then more variants will need to be tested, thus the exercise becomes progressively harder, and the balance of power seems to shift in favor of the platform. Below I give a more formal argument for this (\"Venn diagram model\").\n\nThe same prediction also applies to government censorship. Governments which use simple word-matching to detect anti-government language can be circumvented by using indirect language. Better AI will allow governments to classify every post with reliability as high as if they had a human read each one, and so indirect language or obfuscation will no longer be an effective workaround for censorship (however see below for context-specific violations).\n\nThis prediction would fail if there were substantial limits on the performance of AI, e.g. if there were ways of obfuscating content so that a human would recognize it but no AI could. It seems plausible that AI systems will remain less flexible than humans in understanding for a long time but, because they are trained on enormous quantities of data, if they miss a subclass of violating content in the short-run they would be able to quickly learn to identify it from fresh human-labeled data.\n\nWhether prevalence will decline all the way to zero depends on the definition of prevalence used. An AI model can never perfectly predict human-rater evaluation because humans are themselves noisy: there is typically substantial between-rater and within-rater variation in labelling for any given piece of content.\n\n Test cite to @qin2023large.\n\n[^metaDecline]: It is important to remember that the \"proactive rate\" is the share of *detected* content that is detected by AI, the share of *violating* content that is detected by AI will certainly be significantly lower but is not generally reported. See Meta's [Community Standards report](https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/) and [my visualization of this data](http://tecunningham.github.io/2023-01-31-social-media-suspensions-data.html#meta-facebook-instagram). It's also worth noting that Mark Zuckerberg made a series of predictions that human raters could be substituted with AI, which I think has turned out to be largely correct despite widespread skepticism (including by me), e.g. in late 2018 he [said](https://www.facebook.com/notes/751449002072082/) \"through the end of 2019, we expect to have trained our systems to proactively detect the vast majority of problematic content.\"\n\n[^employment]: A corollary of this prediction is that employment of human moderators will decline: as computer accuracy improves there will be less need for humans, and newer computer models require less human-labeled training data. Whitlock Lees (2022) above demonstrates that their model can do well at zero-shot or one-shot classification tasks. Also @qin2023large finds.\n\n<!-- examples of obfuscation:\n- \"regarded\" for \"retarded\" on r/wallstreetbets\n- \"Unalived\" for \"dead\" on TikTok (Colin Fraser)\n- \"ypipo\" for \"white people\" on Black twitter (Colin Fraser)- -->\n\n<!-- Suppose our \"ground truth\" definition used for prevalence calculations was when 2/3 of experienced raters mark content as violating. In this case even filtering with a theoretically perfect AI model would not drive prevalence to zero (a theoretically perfect AI model would predict the ground truth but still be stochastic because of between-rater and within-rater variation). -->\n\n##          The Prevalence of *Context-Specific* Violations Will Increase\n\nAlthough prevalence of explicitly policy-violating content seems likely to decline we should expect platform users to substite towards producing content that achieves their intent (communicating a violating message) without being flagged as violating (having a human rater recognize the message as violating). I will call this a \"context-specific violation\": a post that is interpreted by the intended viewers to have a significance that is violating, but interpreted by professional raters (who are not given any information about context) as having a non-violating significance.[^definition] Some examples:[^selective]\n\n- Saying \"globalist\" when your audience understands it to mean \"jewish\"\n- Saying the opposite of what is meant, e.g. a bigot saying excessively positive things about an ethnic group, or a pro-anorexia poster making anti-anorexic statements sarcastically.\n- Using euphemisms for illegal substances or illegal acts.\n- Using emojis of eggplants and peaches.\n- Using photos without explicit nudity but which can be read as pornographic.\n\n<!-- should have better terminology: \"context-specific violation\" sounds like a subset of \"violation\" -->\n\nAs AI improves the ability to detect violations it seems likely that there will be at least some substitution towards context-specific violations.\n\nPlatforms could expand their operational definition of a violation by either (1) giving raters more detail about the context and the prior history of the post's author, or (2) raters could be assigned to posts depending on their experience with the argot of the community. Likewise AI models could be trained to include rich representation of the context.^[Platforms already have some policies that include context, e.g. Facebook's [\"Bullying and Harassment policy\"](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/)  bans \"repeatedly contacting someone in a manner that is unwanted or sexually harassing.\"] An additional advantage of adding context is that it can identify and exempt posts that violate the letter but not the spirit of the policy.\n\nHowever there are reasons why platforms may be reluctant to use context in determining violations: it is more complex, and can lead to awkward PR where the platform is shown to be censoring apparently harmless words and images. Additionally platforms may care more about being seen to restrict harmful content than about the actual harm prevented.\n\nIn the earlier history of broadcast media there have been many cases where contextual violations were allowed: e.g. newspapers would allow classified advertisments for prostitutes if described as masseuses, vibrators if described as massage wands, contraception if described as marital aids, and abortion if described as [\"removal of obstructions\"](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/08/history-of-contraception-19th-century-classified-ads-for-abortifacients-and-contraceptives.html). Thus it seems likely that platforms will tolerate a substantial amount of contextually-violating content to remain.[^marketplaceGuns]\n\n[^marketplaceGuns]: In Facebook's Marketplace it is prohibited to list guns for sale. As a consequence people began to list gun *cases*, with the understanding that a case was standing in for a gun. Facebook then updated their policy to prohibit selling gun cases. In turn people began to list gun stickers as stand-ins for guns. See WSJ reports from [2020](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gun-sellers-are-sneaking-onto-facebooks-booming-secondhand-marketplace-11566315198) and [2021](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gun-sellers-use-new-tactic-to-deal-on-facebook-marketplace-11598270872).\n\nIn contrast government censorship is unlikely to be constrained by context-specific violations: once a censor discovers that a term has an anti-government significance in a certain context then they are likely to start censoring that term. E.g. China has suppressed online mentions of [Winnie the Pooh](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-40627855) because it is associated with criticism of Xi Jinping, and in 2022 Hong Kong police arrested protestors for holding blank pieces of paper.[^HongKong]\n\n<!-- Old Soviet joke: A man hands out leaflets on Red Square, and the KGB arrest him. But when they get him to the station, they find that the leaflets are all blank. And he says \"Well, everyone knows what the problem is, so why bother writing it down?\" -->\n\n<!-- add Google papers on detecting toxicity in context -->\n\n[^definition]: Other literature talks about \"veiled\", \"disguised\", or \"covert\" toxic speech, however with a different definition, instead focussing on toxic speech that existing classifiers do poorly on but which humans can accurately label without context. E.g. [Han et al. (2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.622/) say veiled toxicity includes \"codewords, novel forms of offense, and subtle and often unintentional manifestations of social bias such as microaggressions and condescension.\" [Lees (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.hcinlp-1.3/) say \"covert toxicity ... includes types of toxicity that may not be immediately obvious. Covertly toxic comments may use obfuscation, code words, suggestive emojis, dark humor, or sarcasm ...[and] [m]icroaggressions.\" Both papers train models to identify veiled toxicity using content along, without surrounding context.]\n\n[^HongKong]: https://www.axios.com/2022/11/28/china-protests-blank-paper-covid \n\n[^selective]: A related phenomena is people using selective truths to give an impression that is false. E.g. it is common for anti-vaccination groups to refrain from posting provably false claims and instead post only those true claims which reflect badly on vaccines. People with a bias against some ethnic group likewise often refrain from posting provably false claims but post only those true claims that reflect badly on the hated group. Because the pool of true claims is enormous it is easy to collect a large set of true claims that collectively give a false impression.\n\n##          The Prevalence of Variants of Known-Violating Content Will Decline\n\nMany platforms try to detect content that matches content in a database, e.g. databases of illegal sexual media (PhotoDNA), IP-protected content (Content ID), or terrorist recruitment content (GIFCT). People who upload this content thus will try to obfuscate their content to confuse the matching algorithms, e.g. by adding noise.[^SignalSharing]\n\n[^SignalSharing]: other \"signal sharing\" programs: NCMEC, GIFCT, StopNCII. Meta runs the \"ThreatExchange\" platform.\n\nImprovements to AI will help both parties but it seems likely that the AI will help platforms relatively more. As I argue in the model below: as AI recognition approaches a human level it will be difficult to upload a recognizable variant of a known piece of violating content without the platform automatically labelling it as such.\n\n##          Platforms Will Not Be Able to Identify Bots from Their Behavior\n\nMost online platforms struggle with automated users (bots) who are disruptive in a variety of ways. One way of protecting against bots is with behavioral tests, e.g. a CAPTCHA test asking users an image-recognition task[^captcha], or by using on-platform behavior to detect whether a user is human. However improvements in AI mean that computers can now recognize most images as well as humans, and can learn to imitate human-style behavior patterns, so it seems likely these behavioral tests will become ineffective against sophisticated actors. @searles2023empirical finds that most contemporary types of CAPTCHAs can be solved by bots with higher than human accuracy (p10).[^fingerprinting]\n\nThis does not imply that the prevalence of bots will increase. All platforms need some defense against bots so they will have to rely relatively more on other forms of authentication: monetary payment, offline identity credentials (government ID, credit card number), hard-to-fake metadata (e.g. unique IP address, device ID), or 3rd-party authentication (e.g. from Google, Apple).^[The 3rd-party identity providers will themselves have to rely on some other ground truth when accepting signups.] Thus the barriers to signing up for a service (and especially posting on it) will become higher.\n\n[^captcha]: CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.\n\n[^fingerprinting]: Similarly behavioural fingerprinting will become ineffective against advanced actors, e.g. using voice recognition to verify identity.\n\n##          Platforms Will Find It Hard to Discriminate between Real and Fake Media\n\nThere are a number of properties where the ground truth depends on the relationship between the content and the real world:\n\n   - Whether some media (audio, photo, video) has been manipulated or synthesized.\n   - Whether text was written by a human or a computer (e.g. by GPT).\n   - Whether text was written by a specific person.\n\n   Better AI will make it easier to predict each of these properties all else equal. However better AI will also make it easier for computers to obfuscate or synthesize fake content. It seems likely that the latter effect will dominate: it will gradually become possible to camouflage computer-generated content such that neither a computer nor a human could tell them apart. If the content-producer has access to the platforms' model then they can keep perturbing their fake media until it is labelled as non-fake. This is consistent with current evidence that generated-media detectors have relatively poor performance: OpenAI announced a model to detect LLM-created text in January 2023, but then [shut it down](https://decrypt.co/149826/openai-quietly-shutters-its-ai-detection-tool) in July 2023 because of poor performance. In June 2023 the NYT compared a variety of tools to detect computer-generated images and found that with minimal effort they [could be reliably fooled](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/28/technology/ai-detection-midjourney-stable-diffusion-dalle.html).\n\n   It seems likely that prevalence of fake media will increase on unmoderated platforms, though much of that increase will likely to be replacing simple false assertions without any veridical evidence. However the major platforms have strong reason to reduce the spread of fake media[^ranking], and can control it with indirect means, e.g. Meta and YouTube dramatically decreased the prevalence of misinformation over 2016-2020 not primarily through better detection of whether a claim is false, but by a host of indirect measures. Thus I do not expect overall prevalence of fake factual media to substantially increase on the major platforms.\n\n   [^ranking]: See discussion in my note on [how platforms rank](http://tecunningham.github.io/2023-04-28-ranking-by-engagement.html). \n   \n##          Fake Media (Deepfakes) Will Not Have a Substantial Influence on Politics\n\nAs it becomes cheaper to manipulate and synthesize media then people are likely to become more skeptical and rely relatively more on the *provenance* of information. Thus although synthetic media will likely circulate I do not think it will have a substantial influence on beliefs in equilibrium.\n\n   It is already fairly easy to forge or alter documents, or edit video in a misleading way, and as a consequence mainstream media organizations typically do not publish leaked materials unless they have either a chain or provenance for the leaks or independent confirmation of their content. Influential forgeries have been historically much rarer than influential true leaks: over the past 25 years I estimate perhaps 10% of all influential leaks were based on forged materials.[^twoCases][^videoLeaks]\n\n   A great deal of false claims already circulate on the internet and it's not clear that the quality of the faked media is an important constraint on the volume. circulates, especially in the losely moderated part of the internet (e.g. by email, on Telegram, 4chan, Truth Social, WhatsApp, Twitter). It's not uncommon to find a clip of an interview with a politician edited to make it appear that they are admitting to a crime or secret agenda.[^Snopes] If people already take what they see at face value then adding deepfakes seems unlikely to change their opinions substantially. Alternatively if people are skeptical and look for corroborating sources then, again, deepfakes would be unpersuasive. It seems that deepfakes would only be influential if there are a significant population who are exposed to many lies but are not persuaded because the documentary evidence is not sufficiently strong (photos, audio, videos).\n\n   [^twoCases]: I know of two forged documents that were widely taken as true in the last 25 years, from around 15 substantial leaks that I could find: (1) the \"yellowcake\" letters from Iraq to Niger, cited in the 2002 US case for war against Iraq; (2) a fake G W Bush military transcript reported on by CBS and Dan Rather in 2004. It's notable both that these cases are somewhat rare, and that each was passed through a chain of apparently reputable parties.\n\n   [^videoLeaks]: This argument implies that, prior to AI, anonymously leaked video would be more likely to be published and circulated than anonymously leaked documents, because video is harder to fake. In fact I cannot think of many cases of influential anonymous leaks of videos. When Trump's \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked to the Washington Post they got confirmation before publishing it. In fact maybe leaked video has always been untrustworthy because it has always been easy to make deceptive edits.\n\n   [^Snopes]: Snopes.com has an enormous database of both false claims and misleadingly manipulated media that has circulated since 1994. A typical [recent example](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/03/scicheck-video-targets-gates-with-old-clip-misleading-edit/) is an edit of a Bill Gates interview to make it appear he wants to use vaccination to reduce population growth.\n\n   <!-- discuss Pentagon photo -->\n\n   <!-- **The informative value of photos and videos will decline.** Photos, audio and videos will become less persuasive. For example suppose police could alter surveillance camera footage to remove or add someone just by typing an instruction to a video-editing program. -->\n\n   <!-- Circulation of fake information: we have already adapted (1) skepticism (\"don't believe what u read on the internet\"); (2) platforms get burned by it so try to reduce distribution. Not sure whether adding audio/video would add to this. -->\n\n<!-- \n\n\n##          Influence Operations Will Become Somewhat More Effective\n\nGovernment-sponsored influence operations typically employ many people to write posts and messages, and LLMs would make the creation of messages much cheaper. However as people come to encounter more personalized messages they are likely to adopt a higher level of skepticism which would somewhat blunt the advantage due to LLMs.\n\nInfluence operations often repeat the same message from many accounts but there is value in customizing the message so that (1) it is harder for platforms to detect that messages are coming from a  common source; (2) the messages can be context-specific, e.g. replying to another user's tweet or conducting a conversation over direct messages.[^SIO]\n\nThe ability of LLMs to generate customized messages at almost zero cost are likely to help influence operations, who already employ many humans to create customized messages.[^IRA]\n\nConcretely we would expect users to encounter replies on public posts, replies to their own posts, and direct messages, all of which are practically indistinguishable from human-generated replies, but are in fact synthesized by LLMs either for the purpose of persuading, or to establish a connection which can later be used to persuade.\n\nIn the pre-LLM environment it is reasonable to assume that a small-scale message is from a human and is expressing a good-faith opinion because it would not be worthwhile for an influence operation to spend money on individualized messages. In the post-LLM environment the assumption no longer holds thus we might expect an uptick in the effectiveness of persuasion. The overall quantity of influence-operations messages might stay roughly the same because the operations will still be fighting to hide from the platforms (hide from the platforms' bot-detectors and influence detectors).\n\nHowever rather there are reasons to think that users will learn to be more skeptical. We know that skepticism adjusts to the circumstance in many other areas: most people who live in a big city in the 21st century have learned to be skeptical in the folllowing circumstances,\n\n- Receiving a letter which is hand-addressed or a letter stamped \"congratulations.\"\n- Receiving an unsolicited phone call from the bank or from tech support.\n- Receiving a visit from someone who claims to be from the gas company.\n- Being approached on the street by someone who says they lost their wallet.\n\nIt seems likely that people will generally update to learn that personalized messages are not to be trusted. The majority of personalized messages are likely to come from commercially-motivated operations, e.g. selling crypto coins or trying to extract credentials, and exposure to these experiences is likely to discredit all personalized messages.\n\nThere will be collateral damage on sincere personalized messages: it will become harder to strike up a friendship on social media or send someone an unsolicited message because people will have an elevated sense of distrust.\n\n<!-- there's a limit on money pump; fool all people all the time -->\n\n[^SIO]: A 2022 [report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04246.pdf) from the Stanford Internet Observatory lists a number of ways in which LLMs could be used by influence operations, mainly by writing copy either for social media posts or for 1:1 message threads.\n\n[^IRA]: The Russian \"Internet Research Agency\" has been [estimated to employ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency) around 1,000 paid posters in 2017. King et al. (2017, APSR) estimate that 0.5% of all social media posts in China are government sponsored, a large share of which seem to be from humans (i.e. not from bots).\n\n\n\n\n##          Communication Will Migrate Towards Large Closed Platforms\n\nIt seems likely that smaller platforms who cannot afford sophisticated defences will become overrun with AI-created bots, spam, obfuscated violating content, and fake media. This would imply that consumers will tend to migrate to larger closed platforms with more effective defences, and which have more restriction on participation. This continues a general movement over the last 20 years of communication moving from small open platforms (independent email, small forums, mailing lists, independent websites) to large closed platforms (large email providers, large social media platforms).\n\n   It also seems likely that people will come to rely more on established sources of truth because they can trust veridical evidence less, e.g. they will rely relatively more on Wikipedia, Community Notes, and mainstream recognized media sources.\n\n   It may be that people come to rely more on cryptographic signing to verify authenticity.  This seems unlikely to me: it is generally more efficient for an intermediary to verify authenticity of senders (AKA filter out frauds) than for users to do it themselves. I think we've seen that in other domains: (1) PGP signing of email has been less important than email providers filtering spam and phishing; (2) SSL certificates in browsers have been less important than browsers giving warnings for suspected phishing sites (e.g. Google's [safe browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com) database of sites with phishing or malware is used to give warnings in Chrome and Safari).\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![](images/2023-06-23-10-30-49.png)\n:::\n\n<!-- Trust in unsourced content will decline, and so network of communication will get *smaller*.

Some examples:\n\n   - **People will synthesize completely new violating images/videos.** [Thiel et al. 2023](https://purl.stanford.edu/jv206yg3793) say that, as of early 2023, less than 1% of child sexual abuse media (CSAM) appears to be synthetically generated. However the ability to synthesize has been advancing rapidly: ‚Äùto the point that some images are only distinguishable from reality if the viewer is very familiar with photography, lighting and the characteristics of diffusion model outputs ‚Ä¶ it is likely that in under a year it will become significantly easier to generate adult images that are indistinguishable from actual images.‚Äù\n\n   - **Entertainment content may become overwhelmingly synthetic.** A classifier that can detect whether a photo is pretty can also generate a synthetic photo that is pretty, and a classifier that can detect whether a joke is funny should also be able to generate funny jokes.^[I think language models haven't yet been very good at jokes because they generate one word at a time (autoregressive), while jokes typically have a logical structure such that the setup is probable given the punchline, but not the other way around. When we get language models which generate text using different statistical algorithms (e.g. diffusion instead of autoregressive generation) then it seems likely they'll be able to create good jokes.] On average people spend around 3 hours per day watching entertainment (TV, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram). It seems likely that trained models will be able to synthesize content that is highly engaging though it's hard to anticipate what it will look like.\n\n   - **Producers will synthesize content to sit on the *edge* of a category.** If platforms take action whenever content passes some threshold then adversarial actors will generate or perturb content such that it sits right below the threshold. If a platform removes a photo whenever more than 50% of raters would say it depicts nudity then producers would upload photos which 49% of raters would say depicts nudity. People would upload movies which *almost* look like an existing IP-protected movie, and students might submit essays that are close to existing sources but don't quite trigger the plagiarism detector.\n   \n   <!-- - **Producers will produce ambiguous / bistable  safcontent.** -->\n   <!-- - Will synthesize CSAM. -->\n\n<!--\n   TO ADD: (1) discussion of whether cryptographic and blockchain tech will become more useful; (2) discussion of the value of documentary evidence in more mundane situations -- e.g. using photos and videos as proof in ordinary disputes or criminal trials; (3) using AI to generate content, e.g. letters to the editor, journal submissions: can no longer use superficial coherence as a proxy for underlying quality.\n\n   TO ADD: limits on the classifiers, types of content which they cannot recognize or cannot synthesize to human level.

In these cases the incentives are more likely to be aligned: I can't think of many cases where a sender wishes to be classified as having some good property, but also prefers to not actually have that property.\n- **Selecting with good classifier.** This should eliminate the Goodhart problem.\n\n##          Observations on External Properties\n\n- **Controlling on external properties typically uses metadata.** The primary method for controlling spam is not using content-based classifiers but instead maintaining blacklists of servers: Reiley and Rao (2012) say \"[t]he single most effective weapon in the spam-blocking arsenal turns out to be blacklisting an email server.\" Similarly for misinformation: the most effective measures have not been proactive classifiers (typically low precision, e.g. 10%) or third-party-fact checking (typically high latency). Instead it has been discouragements to posting misinformation, and changes in the overall ranking system.\n- **Cryptographically signing messages.** It still means you must trust *someone*. Digital signing always had limited uptake for email and for SSL on websites: the attention tradeoff implies that it's better if an intermediary does the validation. \n\n##          A model of both\n- There's a set of features 1,...,n, a model can be defined as the number of features that you condition on.

I argue below that the net effect will likely be to help platforms, the basic argument is that if both sides had access to a *perfect* classifier then there would be zero violating content on the platform.^[Yann Lecunn made a similar argument in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1664651158562979841) from June 2023: \"AI is part of the solution here, not part of the problem! It is because of progress in natural language understanding in multiple languages (due to self-supervised transformers) that, for example, hate speech can be detected and taken down in hundreds of languages.\". Although I think the wording is misleading by implying that AI being part of the solution precludes it from also being part of the problem. Also worth noting that LeCun misstates FB's own statistics: he says \"82% of hate speech is taken down automatically by AI before anyone sees it.\" In fact it's 82% of *detected* hate speech (the share of true hate speech detected by AI is necessarily smaller but FB does not report that figure), and the 82% refers to the share that is actioned before it is *reported*, not actioned before it is *seen*.]\n\n**Prevalence of violating content has fallen.** Overall prevalence of violating content has shrunk dramatically over the past 5-10 years on the major social media platforms, and this can largely be attributed to improvements in classifiers.\n\n**Model: a Venn-diagram model of content moderation with classifiers.** I describe a game between a platform and a producer, each of whom has access to a classifier. We want to know the effect on total violating content that survives filtering by the platform. Conclusions:\n\n   1. If a plaform gets a better classifier then less violating content gets through.\n   2. If a producer gets a better classifier then the effect is ambiguous, but probably more violating content will get through. In practice this means producers using an AI model to rephrase text, add noise to photos, or synthesize video, such that the content remains violating but the platform's classifier does not pick it up.\n   3. If both platform and producer get a better classifier then probably less violating content will get through.\n   4. A lot of content will sit *just on the threshold* for getting filtered.\n\n\n##           Model\n\n**The diagram below illustrates three sets of posts:** ^[I'm assuming that the universe is all possible posts, e.g. all possible strings of text, or sets of pixels. Then sets $V$ and $\\hat{V}$ and $M$ will be enormous, but the actually existing posts are only a tiny tiny fraction of the set of possible posts. When calculating prevalence we use cardinality of these sets, implying (1) posts are drawn uniformly from the sets, and (2) there are no identical posts, i.e. each post is drawn at most 1 time.]\n\n- **$V$: posts that are violating** -- according to expert human raters. I'm concentrating on \"self-contained\" rules, e.g. nudity, hate speech, holocaust denial, where the violation depends only on the direct content of the post. I'm not considering categories like misinformation, deepfakes, or spam where violation depends on whether the content is true, or the provenance of the content.\n- **$\\hat{V}$: posts that are classified as violating** -- by the platform's classifier, can parameterize with a threshold ($\\hat{V}(k)$). The red segments below represent the false positives and false negatives of the classifier:\n- **$M$: posts that the producer wants to send** -- i.e., posts that express their message, $M$. We can classify some producers as \"good\" (only wants to send non-violating $M\\cap V=\\varnothing$), or as bad (only want to send violating $M\\cap V=M$).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2023-06-06-effect-of-ai-on-communication_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_9f281ad9b3be8306668017c47ab047c4'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-06-06-effect-of-ai-on-communication_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##           Implications of this Model\n\nSuppose that we remove all detected violating posts (i.e. $\\hat{V}$). In the case illustrated above the posts removed ($M\\cap\\hat{V}$) would be the majority of the producer's posts, and of those that remain only a small share are violating. We can make a few observations given this setup:\n\n\n1. **Improvements to the platform's classifier will reduce prevalence of violating content.** If we hold fixed the producer's production, then as the classifier $\\hat{V}$ gets closer to $V$ we should generally expect fewer false-positives and fewer false-negatives, so overall a better outcome for the platform (there are cases where this wouldn't happen but they seem unusual.)\n\n2. **Improvements to producer's classifier will *probably* increase prevalence of violating content.** Suppose that producers have their own estimate of the platform's classifier, $\\tilde{V}$, and they will produce posts uniformly from the set they believe will not be removed, i.e. from the set $M \\backslash \\tilde{V}$. If the producer learns the true classifier $\\tilde{V}=\\hat{V}$ then they will reduce their rate of deleted posts, which is good for the producer, but the effect on the platform can be ambiguous:\n   \n   - **For good producers:** For producer who do not wish to produce violating content ($M\\cap V=\\varnothing$) knowledge of the classifier will prevent them from producing false positives, and they will produce more true negatives, which is good for the platform.\n   - **For bad producers:** For producers who *only* want to produce violating content ($M\\cap V=M$) they will increase their rate of violating but non-detected posts (false negatives), which is bad for the platform.\n   - **For neutral producers:** For neutral producers (where $M$ is neither a subset nor mutually exclusive with being violating), the net effect is ambiguous.\n\n   In fact the net effect seems likely to be negative because in most cases people who produce violating content do it on purpose, e.g. those who produce nudity and hate speech and holocaust denial do it intentionally, and they couldn't achieve their purpose without violating the policy.\n\n   **What this looks like in practice:** tricking classifiers by misspelling words, using roundabout phrasing, inverting colours in a photo, adding noise to a video. Earlier classifiers had difficulty with these manipulations but deep neural nets are much better at recognizing the deep content and are harder to confuse.\n\n   **Qualification.** In the argument above I'm holding fixed the platform's classifier $\\hat{V}$. However if the producer changes the posts they produce then the performance of that classifier will change, e.g. precision might fall, and so the full effect should include an adjustment to that classifier. Could add an equilibrium condition that the classifier's threshold $k$ will be set such that precision will be $p$ ($\\frac{|\\hat{V}(k)\\cap V \\cap M|}{|\\hat{V}(k)\\cap M|}=p$). I don't think this would change the qualitative conclusion.\n   \n3. **Improvements to a classifier used by both platform and producer will lower prevalence of violating content.** Suppose both parties used the same classifier ($\\tilde{V}=\\hat{V}$), and that classifier was perfect ($\\tilde{V}=\\hat{V}=V$). Then there will be no violating posts shown: negative producers won't post anything, and neutral and positive producers will only produce non-violating posts. This argument applies to the limit of having a perfect model, but it seems reasonable to presume that on the path to that limit the rate of violating posts will generally decline.\n\n4. **Content will cluster just below the classifier threshold.** So far we have discussed everything in binary terms, thought realistically most things are continuous. If we action posts in a binary manner, e.g. filtering posts with a classifier score above some threshold, then producers will have an incentive to produce posts which are just below the threshold for filtering.\n\n<!-- **Followup: \"open\" policies.** This discussion has been predicated on there being an unambiguous ground truth, $V$. However in some cases violation of the policy can depend on facts outside of the content itself. E.g. whether a post is misinformation (depends on facts in the world), whether a link is exaggerating or leads to an ads-farm (depends on the content of the link), whether a post provokes hate speech (depends on user response to the post), whether a post is inauthentic (depends on whether author is who they claim to be). I think the analysis will be a bit different then. -->\n\n#           Appendix: Discrimination Model\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2023-06-06-effect-of-ai-on-communication_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_fd163181fb4087fc4bff22292f7fde9a'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2023-06-06-effect-of-ai-on-communication_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#           Appendix: Forecasts from Metaculus\n\n|                                                                        | deadline | Metaculus Jun 30 2023 |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |\n| Will a deepfake cause damage & make front page of a major news source? | 2023     | 89%              |\n| Will a deepfake be blamed by G20 politician for election loss?         | 2025     | 80%              |\n| Will AI be used in an attack on infrastructure costing >$1B?           | 2025     | 4%               |\n| Will AI be used in a theft of intellectual property cost >$10M?        | 2025     | 30%              |\n| Will AI cause a stock exchange to halt trading for >24 hours?          | 2025     | 15%              |\n| Will AI be used in a major attack on voting systems in G20?            | 2025     | 10%              |\n|                                                                        |          |                  |\n| Will a deepfake about politicial running for office get 2M+ views?     | 2018     | (resolved false) |\n| Will a wide-scale video hoax put words in a famous figure's mouth?     | 2017     | (resolved false  |\n\n<!-- \n##       Artificial Media Forecasts\n\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/10955/ai-generated-film-ranked-1-in-streaming/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17447/ai-generated-movie-accomplishments/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8403/25-top-100-songs-made-by-ai-by-2050/ -->\n\n\n\n<!-- **Each questions asks the probability of significant intentional damage caused with the use of AI.** \n\n**I think a reasonable starting point would be 50% of the historical base-rate of each type of damage.** Assume (1) AI will help attackers and defenders about equally, so total successful attacks will be constant; (2) AI will be used in 50% of successful attacks.
