Why I think AI take-off is relatively slow

I’ve already covered much of this in [my podcast with Dwarkesh](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/tyler-cowen-4), but I thought it would be useful to write it all out in one place. I’ll assume you already know the current state of the debate. Here goes:

1. Due to the Baumol-Bowen cost disease, less productive sectors tend to become a larger share of the economy over time. This already has been happening since the American economy originated. A big chunk of current gdp already is slow to respond, highly inefficient, governmental or government-subsidized sectors. They just won’t adopt AI, or use it effectively, all that quickly. As I said to an AI guy a few days ago “The way I can convince you is to have you sit in on a Faculty Senate meeting.” And the more effiicient AI becomes, the more this trend is likely to continue, which slows the prospective measured growth gains from AI.

2. Human bottlenecks become more important, the more productive is AI. Let’s say AI increases the rate of good pharma ideas by 10x. Well, until the FDA gets its act together, the relevant constraint is the rate of drug approval, not the rate of drug discovery.

2b. These do not have to be regulatory obstacles, though many are. It may be slow adopters, people in the workplace who hate AI, energy constraints, and much more. It simply is not the case that all workplace inputs are rising in lockstep, quite the contrary.

3. The O-Ring models makes AI hard to work with. The O-Ring model stipulates that, in some settings, it is the worst performer who sets the overall level of productivity. (In the NBA, for instance, it may be the quality of the worst defender on the floor, since the player your worst defender is supposed to guard can just keep taking open shots.) Soon enough, at least in the settings where AI is supposed to shine, the worst performer will be the humans. The AIs will make the humans somewhat better, but not that much better all that quickly.

This is a variant of #2, but in more extreme form. A simple way to put it is that you are not smart enough to notice directly how much better o5 will be than o3. For various complex computational tasks, not observed by humans, the more advanced model of course will be more effective. But when it comes to working with humans, those extra smarts largely will be wasted.

3b. The human IQ-wages gradient is quite modest, suggesting that more IQ in the system does not raise productivity dramatically. You might think that does not hold across the super-intelligent margin the machines will inhabit, but the O-Ring model suggests otherwise, apart from some specialized calculations where the machine does not need to collaborate with humans.

4. I don’t think the economics of AI are well-defined by either “an increase in labor supply,” “an increase in TFP,” or “an increase in capital,” though it is some of each of those. It is more like “some Star Trek technology fell into our backyard, and how long will it take us to figure out how to integrate it with other things humans do?” You can debate how long that will take, but the Solow model, the Romer model and their offshoots will not give us reliable answers.

5. There is a vast literature on the diffusion of new technologies (go ask DeepResearch!). Historically it usually takes more time than the most sophisticated observers expect. Electricity for instance arguably took up to forty years. I do think AI will spread faster than that, but reading this literature will bring you back down to earth.

6. Historically, gdp growth is remarkably smooth, albeit for somewhat mysterious reasons. North America is a vastly different place than it was in the year 1600, technologically and otherwise. Yet there are remarkably few years when the economic growth rate is _all that far_ from two percent. There is a Great Depression, some years of higher growth, some stagnation, and a few major wars, but even in those cases we are not so far from two percent. I do not pretend to be able to model this satisfactorily (though the above factors surely have relevance in non-AI settings too), but unless you have figured this puzzle out, do not be too confident in any prediction that is so very far from two percent.

7. I’ve gone on record as suggesting that AI will boost economic growth rates by half a percentage point a year. That is very much _a guess_. It does mean that, with compounding, the world is very different a few decades out. It also means that year to year non-infovores will not necessarily notice huge changes in their environments. So far I have not seen evidence to contradict that broad expectation.

8. Current prices are not forecasting any kind of very rapid transformation. And yes market traders do know about AI, AGI, and the like.

9. None of these views are based on pessimism about the capabilities of AI models. I hear various views, often from people working in the area, and on the tech per se I have an optimism that corresponds to the weighted average of what I hear.

I think people started talking about the paperless workplace in the late 90s. From my experience, it took about 20 years for most workplaces to actually go (mostly) paperless.

New technology takes a while to implement for several reasons. First, most decision-makers in most workplaces are on the older side and are inherently conservative. They don't really understand new technology and what it is capable of and don't feel the urgency of change. They won't change until all of the companies they watch and get their ideas from change first. Second, implementing tools takes time and effort. Someone needs to identify which particular processes can be automated or sped up with AI and train the people involved. Finding someone with both the time and knowledge to roll out AI tools in an organization typically requires sign-off from the decision-makers, so then we are back to the first problem.

It would be naive to assume older decision makers don't understand the technology. They've gone through this before when they absolutely understood and were comfortable the technology, but saw why it's never really about the technology. Skepticism that really for reals this time it's going to rapidly change everything is healthy and understandable.

It's not about the technology, it's about the people.

"I think people started talking about the paperless workplace in the late 90s"

I remember people talking about a paperless office in the early 80s. Wiki states that a Business Week article mentioned a paperless office in 1975... "and ['paperless office'] came to prominence with the introduction of the personal computer. While the prediction of a PC on every desk was remarkably prophetic, the "paperless office" was not." (One person's opinion.)

Ray Kurzweil predicted in 1990 that between 1995 to 2000: "Documents frequently never exist on paper because they incorporate information in the form of audio and video pieces" (Wrong.)

Kurzweil predicted in 1998 that in 2019: "Paper books and documents are rarely used and most learning is conducted through intelligent, simulated software-based teachers." (Both are still a few years away but only a few...)

AND many very important documents (mortgage contracts say) require a live human signing in blue ink in front a notary. So the *MOST IMPORTANT* documents are still paper.

True, except decision-makers don't drive change. "Subordinates" and their skills do.

It's not either/or. You can have a workplace full of creative subordinates but if they are busy with lots of things, they aren't going to have the energy to take on another project.

But in the case of AI, higher-ups will insert themselves into the process because most tools cost money and require sharing data. So someone needs to spend time researching various tools and having lawyers read contracts to make sure that no proprietary information is being used to train models.

With low-price tech that is available to individuals and businesses alike, such as AI, this is the basic order of events:

1. New useful tech shows up.

 2. Most people don’t use it.

 3. A few early adopters do use it *and these folks will overwhelmingly be non-executives*—i.e., subordinates—because executives are only a tiny fraction of the workforce. It’s just the stats. Personality types probably matter too. If you’re an executive, you’re probably not too gadget-focused, especially if the gadget requires practice to use productively. Instead, you’re business-focused, as you should be.

 4. A few non-executive early adopters demonstrate, intentionally or not, and maybe even to the displeasure of the executives, that the new tech has useful business cases. Early spreadsheets are the classic example of initial company displeasure. Imagine executives resisting the tech that would make them, in the aggregate, trillions of dollars, and punishing the employees who used it.

 5. Companies that, intentionally or not, follow the lead of the early adopters—who, again, because of the math, will be overwhelmingly subordinates just deciding to use it—out-compete those that don’t.

 6. As a consequence, the tech becomes ubiquitous in business, because companies that don’t adopt it die out.

So if you have a job where AI is useful, just use it. In a forum like this, I’m highly confident that is happening among readers.

This order applies only to tech that everyday people have easy access to. Obviously, expensive, specialized equipment takes a different route.

Far less incentive to change, system is already working for them, little reason to mess with it particularly as you're on way out (even if that may take 5-10 years). And the younger seems more likely to be subject to distraction, even if some will use LLMs to change the world and work, and also don't have the power (and frequently not the motivation) to change a given organization's use of tech. Obvious example everyone always trots out: video calling existed forever before covid convinced people to use it.

These all seem like different ways of saying that production of goods and services require lots of different inputs, i.e., land, labor, and capital. The gating input is the one is shortest supply, not the ones in abundance. So, Moore's law doubled transistors per unit cost every 18 months or so for decades. With more transistors than we knew what to do with, that was not the gating input so growth proceeded at 2% per year, not 100% per 18 months. Ditto AI-compute. It's not the gating factor.

This also explains why innovation in the world of bits doesn't necessarily lead to innovation in the world of atoms. AI is innovation in the world of bits.

It's honestly not that exceptionally useful outside of a few cases, unless you're programming or writing tons of long, customized emails.

The real big use-case for this for a lot of businesses would be if you could get them reliable enough to do voice-support over the phone for customer service (beyond just the usual "automated help line" that everybody hates). Having effectively unlimited customer service agents to spin up to meet demand would be a big deal for a consumer-facing company - imagine never having to wait on a phone queue ever again for most phone customer service.

Yes, which is why I remain skeptical of the extravagant claims by Tyler and other AI-optimists (Tyler's 0.5% growth increase does sound plausible).

Unlike other industrial activities, the benefits of improved computerized customer service are obvious; there are billions of dollars of savings clearly in sight.

And companies have been the opposite of Luddites and slow adopters; they have been "innovating" in this area for decades -- with resulting customer service that's worse than what humans offer.

It's been over two years since ChatGPT 3.5 was released. Where are the improved customer service chatbots? I've seen only marginal improvements (which might not be improvements at all, but just my subjective impression). This is not a task that requires AGI (seemingly anyway; see the last mile problem below); just create chatbots that don't suck.

Hollis Robbins nailed it with a post that Tyler linked to a couple of months ago: AI can get us 85%-95% of the way to a good solution, but it can't do the "last mile" task.

(And then Hollis Robbins wrote an exceedingly silly post about how universities should be planning right now how to deal with AGI, which is a lot like saying that their facilities and physical plant staff should be figuring out how to utilize nuclear fusion.)

Hollis Robbins 85% to 95% will be correct for 2025 to 2028 but that's about it. (AI passed doctors in making accurate diagnosis in many areas 5 years ago.) Robbins recent essay will look correct in 3 to 5 years but think she should have said AI instead of AGI, which is a distraction.

If she had said that universities need to be figuring out how to deal with AI, her post would've been equally pointless, because universities have already been dealing with AI ever since ChatGPT 3.5 was released. Assignments, tests, and assessments had to be redesigned.

And instructors started figuring out how to change their lesson plans and teaching techniques, but that's a slower process. The major higher educ media have articles on how to handle or use AI in the classroom and on the campus literally every week and have been doing so for two years.

I think you're underselling the value of being exceptionally good at programming computers, especially when that is itself an input into improving AI systems.

And if previous trends in performance improvement continue in any way, we can expect multiple OOM improvements over the next few years. When these models get 100 or 1000x better, customer service will be a footnote to what they can do.

As a consumer, I’d like to be able to tell a personal AI what the problem is and have it called the company for me.

More seriously, I think a potential B2B use case is for companies to pay Open AI or Google or Facebook to invest all their documentation and training materials and provide first level support from those interfaces. “Questions about your bill? Just ask Chat GPT.”

In my experience, the hardest part of (useful) innovation is figuring out what customers want. Mostly, because even customers themselves often don't know what they want or, more precisely, don't know what they will want in the future when the innovative tech will finally be available for them to try out. If AI take-off has been slow --- compared to what? --- then, by definition, it has been improving along dimensions that customers don't find particularly useful. (Apparently, customers don't find AI that can score well on the SATs particularly useful, for example.)

And, no, it's not a matter of making the AI "smart" enough so that we can just ask AI what customers want. Silicon Valley folks should know as well as anyone that the smartest engineers don't necessarily know better than anyone else what customers want. It's a trial and error process, not an IQ test.

There are huge numbers of very smart, competent, and informed folk who have basically no idea what LLMs can do right now. We're at the stage where your parents didn't understand why you would need a smart phone, and within a couple years had pivoted to using it almost as much as the kids for all sorts of things (why do I need uber, there are taxis? why do I need an electronic ticket when there's paper? etc.).

This is not what "take-off" means in an AI context. That refers to the speed of the transition from neat chatbot to godlike superintelligence and whether it happens slowly enough for humans to remain in control. Asking about the speed of adpotion into daily life or speed of economic growth/transformation is fine but it's not the speed of "AI take-off".

Cowen's use of "take off" for AI is not as common but was often used do describe that take off of the internet in the 1990s with phone lines and in 2000s with cable. The reader understands which type of take off he is using.

There's something else that perhaps goes up there with #3, perhaps 3c. You can't always take a particular workflow as is, swap-in an AI for this or that task or set of tasks, and then keep on going with the same workflow. To get the most effective use of the AI you have to re-factor the workflow taking the AI's capacities into account. That's a tricky business, especially since the AI's capacities might not be very legible.

BTW, this isn't my idea. Tyler posted it here sometime in the last X months, but I forget who he attributed it to. Or maybe it was in a comment. I don't really know, but I got it here.

Good comment. It's a truism - based on experience - that you need to clean up the workflows before you automate them. Understanding the workflows well enough to clean them up (refractor them) is often iterative, and in my experience, often the most interesting part of the problem.

And as someone (perhaps you) noted above, the real payoffs come when you get the last mile problem solved, and the whole end-to-end workflow is automated.

Either by reworking a not too entrenched workflow, or just creating a workflow around LLMs. E.g., a new doctor who just starts with all patients submitting to LLM questioning, based on uploaded records, etc., rather than trying to figure out how to work LLM into preexisting workflow involving office visits, etc.

Tell your friends to stop being weenies. If it weren’t ai it’d be climate change and if not that bird flu, crime, asteroids etc etc. it’s not about ai, it’s about being a weenie.

So stop being a weenie and make that baby. Babies are great. They’re cute, they’re fun, they’re a lot of work and they’re with you forever as people. They’ll figure out what they’ll do for a living on their own after twenty some years. Your job is to make them. Not be a waffle weenie.

Having kids in order that they should have a career still seems to me like putting the cart before the horse. Ask them if they are worried if their kids will not be able to have a decent standard of living compared with their ancestors a few generations ago, or by the standards of the global median person, and if they're not concerned about that, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me for them to not have children. (But equally if they don't want to, fine, if we are going to have such good AI, it doesn't really matter).

Let's say those children can't do anything. Computers/robots are doing *everything*. Manufacturing everything. Driving. Teaching children. Caring for the elderly. Building houses.

Those computers/robots are going to be doing things for far, far less money than humans want for those tasks. So everything is going to be tremendously inexpensive. And *somebody* is going to be getting money for the things the computers/robots do, unless the computers/robots suddenly develop a human emotion of valuing money.

The simple solution is to tax the people making all that money on behalf of the computers/robots, and spread it out as a guaranteed income approximately equal (PPP adjusted) to what the average person earns in the U.S.

So, tell your friends to have all the children they want. They may live their entire adult lives similar to a retired person now...getting an income that allows them to live comfortably without having to work. I can tell them from personal experience, it's not a bad setup at all.

:-)

This is a good idea, but institutions and organizations don't implement good ideas. They implement the ideas that increase the power of the people who decide which ideas to implement.

They are also constrained by path dependence, the route of decisions and extensions the organization made in the past leading to the current decision.

> This is a good idea, but institutions and organizations don't implement good ideas.

I'm not proposing that people do something a certain way. I'm predicting what *will* actually happen.

If AI/robots can do all things, and the AI/robots don't suddenly develop a human desire to get money for themselves, then the prices of virtually everything should go way down. That's because the human owners of the AI/robots can charge much less and still make a profit.

For example, say an AI/robot can replace your primary care physician, and that AI/robot costs $100,000, and lasts 5 years. That's only $20,000 a year! So the AI/robot owner can make a massive profit by charging $50,000 a year...and still vastly undercut the cost of your human primary care physician. So things should generally get much less expensive (for the same or better quality).

Now, in that situation, your primary care physician, and all physicians, are out of lucrative jobs, and the money is instead going to the owner of the AI/robots.

But if the vast majority of people are out of work, and the owners of the AI/robots are getting all the money, then the vast majority who are out of work will simply vote to tax away some of the money that the owners of the AI/robots are getting, to give to the people who are unemployed.

And, in general, the AI/robot owners will pay those taxes. For example, I assume Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etc. pay taxes. But they're still billionaires, so the marginal value of the money they pay in taxes isn't really a big deal to them.

This is a dream and utterly naive.

Money means power means more money. No one has enough money to satisfy themself. The owners of the AI/robots will seek (are seeking) hegemony because they can; it is increasingly within reach. They sow dissent among those out-of-work, to divide the majority.

Musk is the rule, not the exception. It's an old story that will be exacerbated because AI is incentivized to behave just like humans.

Relatedly, one of the main functions of AI so far is to make it easier to consolidate insights from information.

This will partly make decision-making easier, and speed the pace with which decisions are made. But as the price of insights goes down, some of the lower cost gets eaten up by higher “consumption” of insights.

This is already observable from historical trends: compare the number of charts and the depth of analysis that goes into, say, a CEO-level presentation today compared to thirty years ago.

The greater level of analysis is partly because the insights are actually value-adding - but also partly because of inter-manager competition to present the most-well-thought-through work, reflect in shifting expectations regarding what is a “good” presentation, etc.

Cowen is making the case that the enormous investment in AI is vastly superior to an equal amount invested in productive capital (plant, machinery, etc.), the reason being that investment in productive capital is burdened by, you guessed it, humans that are required to make productive capital, well, productive. A counterargument (there are many) is that being burdened by humans is a feature, not a bug, because it slows down change to a pace that humans can accept and adapt to. Not every innovation is good for humans; indeed, some innovations are harmful to humans. Most religions, Christianity for sure, place humans at the top of the pyramid. Will AI?

"The human IQ-wages gradient is quite modest"

Is IQ the right thing to look at, though?

Observation: some people are paid 10x others.

Inference: Maybe it's not for IQ, but for behavior, experience, etc. As long as those things can be trained and reproduced at low cost (eventually), then it could be quite impactful. AIs are getting better in many more dimensions than just IQ.

The personality characteristics which align best with success are conscientious and mental stability. Current LLMs have off the charts mental stability. As for conscientious, they are quite amazing, but they can miss items so probably only in the top 90% or higher.

I would suspect that very high percentiles of IQ + conscientious + mental stability will be very impactful.

Also, AI may nudge humans to behave as though they were more conscientious.

As an illustrative scenario I imagine employees at a hospital wearing devices like a better Humane AI pin that prompts them if they don't execute a step on a checklist (yes, _The Checklist Manifesto_ by Gawande impressed me).

Good post from Tyler. Economic growth doesn’t diverge too much from 2% , precisely because innovations only get implemented incrementally over time. There will not be a step function of economic growth from AI , but a steady increase compounding.

GDP also doesn’t measure well quality improvements , better products , safer streets, cheaper health care, less arduous work , more leisure , longer health span, higher well being etc….

We probably live in the most important century of human history, where super intelligences will come into being.

 Will it lead to our flourishing or our eventual demise is not clear. I am on the side of the pessimists. I find it hard to conceive that super intelligences dominating the economy of the future , and deeply embedded in the global internet , whether actually self aware or philosophical zombies , could be fathomed , trusted , and ultimately safely controlled by humans

> 8. None of these views are based on pessimism about the capabilities of AI models. I hear various views, often from people working in the area, and on the tech per se I have an optimism that corresponds to the weighted average of what I hear.

My own optimism is, I strongly suspect, of a somewhat different nature. As long as and to the extent that development is dominated by the cult of scaling, development will lag further and further behind the hype. Reality is under no obligation to conform to human dreams just because lots of money is being thrown at those dreams. I have explained some of this in a [longish piece I published in December of 2023](https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2023/12/aye-aye-capn-investing-in-ai-is-like-buying-shares-in-a-whaling-voyage-captained-by-a-man-who-knows-all-about-ships-and-little-about-whales.html).

More recently, I've drawn a line in the sand, as it were: [The next major AI breakthrough, Part 1: Understanding how LLMs work internally](https://new-savanna.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2025-02-18T13:30:00-05:00&max-results=16). After a little throat-clearing I draw the line:

> We’re not going to have another major breakthrough until we understand how LLMs work internally and, by extension, other learning models as well. Once we understand that we can begin deliberately engineering systems to have pre-specified capabilities. What’s going on now, everything, prompt engineering, inference-time scaling, all of it, it’s all work-arounds, hacking, albeit often inspired hacking. Some of it will no doubt prove useful once we understand what’s really going on under the hood. But most of it will fall away.

That's followed by a little discussion I had with poor old Claude 3.5 on the issue. Claude's final word:

> What's particularly interesting is that the tools we're using to try to understand LLMs include LLMs themselves - they're part of the scientific process of understanding their own operation. This creates a fascinating recursive loop in the development of understanding.

It's a recursive loop that includes humans. The idea that one-day the AIs are going to take thought and zoom off to infinity and beyond, that's a Buzz Lightyear fever dream.

Why did scaling get humanity to build machines that pass the turing test without whitebox model understanding?

Effective steam engines were built before we understood thermodynamics.

"Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recognizer goes up".

I am not saying that a deeper understanding of how LLMs work is not useful, I just don't think that it's absolutely required for progress. Intuition and experimentation got us pretty far, and will likely continue doing so.

I don't think evolution has a deep understanding of high level cognition, even though it managed to create it.

I'm well aware of "fire a linguist." I'm also aware of the fact LLM technology has limitations, such as confabulation, and, as Dread Pirate Marcus has pointed out, [we have yet to see GPT-5](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/breaking-openais-efforts-at-pure). I'm not holding my breath.

The late Dan Dennett was like to talk about design space. Well, the design space of AI has various regions. GOFAI dominates one region. Machine learning has taken us to another region, one dominated by statistical methods. I'm asserting that there's a least one further region, one that is unaccessible unless we understand the internal operations of LLMs and other models. Until then, we're confined to the regions of AI design space that we've already discovered.

I have some preliminary exploration of these issues in a working paper: What Miriam Yevick Saw: [The Nature of Intelligence and the Prospects for A.I., A Dialog with Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.academia.edu/126773246/What_Miriam_Yevick_Saw_The_Nature_of_Intelligence_and_the_Prospects_for_A_I_A_Dialog_with_Claude_3_5_Sonnet_Version_2).

Re: 5

 Recently we've had technologies adopted more rapidly than electricity - including the World Wide Web (on top of the internet), smartphones (on top of the cellular networks), and cloud compute (on top of the internet).

Insightful analysis Tyler. The institutional bottlenecks you identify are real, but complex adaptive systems often surprise us. While individual adoption rates may be constrained, we might see entirely new organizational forms emerge - much like how evolution sometimes creates new levels of organization rather than just optimizing existing ones. The 2% growth pattern could persist even as the underlying processes reorganize in unexpected ways, similar to how water maintains a steady temperature while transitioning to steam.

It cannot create proper APA citations. When you give it a URL to look up a paper it often references an entirely different paper. When you ask it to include a DOI, the DOI is often a broken link.

None of these things are getting any better.

The notion of AI ever doing "creative" work when it cannot even do basic undergraduate-level research drudge work is a complete howler.

If the AI hype was real, take-off would not be generalized. It would show up coming from a small number of scientists and engineers willing and able to fully commit to AI driven workflows. We would see a handful of unusually rapid breakouts in innovation first, not some wide-spread improvements to economic efficiency.

Obviously, there are some anecdotes describing some gains from AI. Do any of those imply that a wider take-off is gaining momentum? Not even close.

Let's keep in mind just how huge the financial commitment has been to AI development. So far, AI has been a massive drain of economic growth. A lot of very smart people are making unprecedented bets that these investments will pay off soon enough, but right now, AI investment is consuming vast resources that would have otherwise produced realized returns.

For now, AI is dragging down economic growth.

It's equally plausible that AI-empowered people will out-muscle today's "top performers," as "top" is a term relative to today's technological environment.

Tyler "Yet there are remarkably few years when the economic growth rate is all that far from two percent."

This isn't correct for America from 1776 to around 1880 for _per capita_ growth, which is the more important trend. The curve is still smooth but not at 2% as that has been accelerating.

I disagree that AI take off has been "relatively slow". It's obviously subjective but almost no companies in the world were using AI in February 2022 and in three years this has reached 30% to 70% depending on the survey question. Unless you were expecting a *FOOM* scenario, this seems fast to me.

Excitement about AI is another way of saying “I don’t know much about it.”

I worked in fraud and money laundering detection models. To do simple tasks as good as a human, such as identifying transacrion patterns, required a lot of statistical sampling and evaluation on a rolling basis.

Thats why I believe AI just means AI customer service reps. To do complex tasks it will require 1000s of people sampling decisions on a rolling basis.

Tech bros want something that scales up. Take it from me - it does not scale up as well as the tech innovations of the 90s.

I can imagine nedia companies among the first and hispitals among the last, but there should be a kind of formula that can predict it for all parts of rhe economy, right?

I see another barrier, I guess I'd call the Overwhelm Factor. As in, it is hard to get a simple answer to the question "What can this do for me?" The answers tend to be "It can do everything!" followed by breathless panting. With Excel, I know what it can do and thus I can evaluate that benefit against my cost of learning to use it. PowerPoint ditto. Email ditto. Etc. But I think it is hard for Average Joes like myself to get a handle on where to start here. Relatedly, we have the Better to Wait Factor. If I hear every damn week about how the new LLM or whatever is so much better than last week's, I am rewarded for never trying one out. This effect is seen in my world (automotive) with many would-be EV buyers: If I know that next year's model will cost less and have more range than this year's, why should I buy now?

3 is obviously wrong ... if it were true, then the player being guarded by defender 5 -- likely to be offensive player 3, 4 or 5 -- would lead the league in scoring. Instead, the stars lead the league in shots and scoring despite being guarded by defensive player 1.

TC is not descriptive. TC reasons from some first principle -- whether it's real or not -- and then goes from there.

Its a mistake to see AI as a single product to be used by your average person, since the real benefit of the general technology is thousands of different subspecialized applications to improve efficiency, revenue, customer outcomes. For example we are rolling out an automated coronary calcium scoring tool for CT scans that will likely generate millions in extra revenue for hospital and improve patient outcomes.

There are also a lot of vested interests working against AI. Look at Intuit. The IRS has tried to make filing tax returns easier, cheaper and more efficient for most people. Expanding that group is an obvious AI application, but Intuit has a good thing going charging people to provide the IRS with information it already knows and doing analysis that the IRS could easily do with AI.

It's similar with NOAA and weather forecasting. NOAA has repeatedly tried to improve and focus weather forecasting. Internally, they've been testing personal and business forecasting using AI, but there are lots of companies that make good profits reselling government data and preventing the government from providing better services.

It's like email. The government came up with an email system in the early 1980s. It let people with accounts send and receive emails with certified addressing service. If someone didn't have an online account, it would send them a paper letter. The goal was to scan incoming letters and provide them online. Naturally, the free market shut this down and delayed email by decades.

Private sector profits are just as likely to come from stopping technological innovation as in advancing it. IBM was notorious for this in the 1960s and 1970s. The government tends to push things forward figuring someone will profit from it eventually and then they'll have to pay taxes on that profit. Right now, we're stuck because the private sector is winning.

These arguments make sense for as long as AI is bottlenecked by humans (or human institutions) -- so if we limit ourselves to worlds where AI is a tool, even an extremely capable one, and where existing institutions manage to hold onto and enforce regulations at human speed, I agree.

I don't think it addresses many of the arguments for the transformative impact of AI though, which (imo) mainly follow from AI doing things independently, and at least some systems not following human regulations.

For example, why would a superintelligent AI only release drugs at the rate that the FDA approves them? Perhaps because its creators programmed it to follow US law... okay, but fast forward two years, and an equivalent system is open source and can be run at home by anyone, and it has no in-built limitations regarding following FDA regulations. What then?

If this system can take in the prompt ‘cure my osteoporosis please’, and figure out what a cure might be, and then pay various other people and AIs around the world to mix the relevant chemicals together and ship them to the house of the user, I don’t think an unassisted FDA would be able to stop it, especially if millions of people are doing the same thing. (If you think this is impractical without trials, imagine that the first few thousand times an AI does this it is trying different candidate cures and tracking the results in some shared database online).

The same applies to Baumol-Bowen cost disease and O-Ring models -- a capable enough AI can largely circumvent things people might do to stop or slow it down. The Faculty Senate meeting is taking too long to decide on some set of actions? What actions can it take that an AI couldn’t just ignore? The worst performing people are slowing the team of AIs down? The AIs can pay them to go away! At some point of capability, ‘specialized calculations where the machine does not need to collaborate with humans’ becomes ‘practically everything’.

Same for people adopting AI, as a general point. If the AI is able to do everything people do, people don’t need to adopt it at all -- it can go out and do every single economically relevant thing on its own, independently, with no adoption required (beyond its initial inventors). If it is limited by capital (and this specific model is somehow aligned not to cheat and steal) you might not have an instant replacement of all useful human work, but it would be far faster than a few percent per year.

I guess the main difference in these views is whether (and how quickly) AI can work independently with no human help. I personally expect that to be possible within 5-10 years, and would agree with you on the slow speed of adoption before that point. I expect the same crux exists for most people who expect a more transformative impact in the short-ish term, and is why so many of the arguments kind of talk past each other. Just a guess, love your work!

I liked the comment about video conferencing being around and not being used until forced to for covid. Stuff happens like that all the time.

I feel like adoption of AI might be quicker than predicted. Other stuff came around faster than electricity, etc -and tech changes have been huge since even the last 15 years.

What I think will force AI is money saving. Companies, even run by conservative oldsters, are always looking for a way to save money. If the entire company ends up vanishing because of AI-it will be financial incentives that force it to happen. Look at how the last decade became all Amazon, and now Amazon has warehouses too.

I am not confident about the teaching thing. I do use a lot of AI to gather info -kids too do, but AI teaching class will be hard simply because it will be INCREDIBLY boring. At least boring teacher has moods and personality. Kids fight anything boring. It has to be very fun bots, or a genuine desire to learn, and that’s not innate in most kids.

I do see Air traffic control as being immensely helped by AI. People I believe will still be needed to manage things, but GPS is already there for us, and AI adopting the existing grid structure and all the inputs about distances and time will be very useful. That terrible accident may force those who run airlines into to wonder -can more automated inputs help give very specific directions and avoid near misses and catastrophes?

You might be able to tell from this post that I am not tech savvy nor inventive. I am a teacher and I am tired, it would be cool to have more AI, but learning is already boring for most kids. I am limited by my experience to see how useful it can be in my field.

Not so mysterious. GDP growth occurs along the various margins of risk, opportunity, and return, and for epistemological, emotional, and bureaucratic reasons, humans are terrible at understanding any of the three.

"_Due to the Baumol-Bowen cost disease, less productive sectors tend to become a larger share of the economy over time. This already has been happening since the American economy originated. A big chunk of current gdp already is slow to respond, highly inefficient, governmental or government-subsidized sectors._"

This seems a bit like confusing BB - where sectors which are harder to improve with technology rise in real term costs/wages - with some governmental regime. BB sectors are sectors that are delivering about as much as is demanded, but it just happens to be the case that those trend towards higher real terms costs / higher welfare for their workers?

4 is an underappreciated point.

I often hear of people who are very enthusiastic about the technology who are surprised about its capabilities. (myself included!) So its capabilities are beyond our imaginations.

To that point, new technologies get adopted using old frameworks. So a gas motor gets bolted onto a horse-drawn carriage until someone figures out a car. A cellular modem gets stuck into something that looks and functions like a home telephone until someone figures out the iPhone.

Also, management applies rigid frameworks to adoption. So if we’re going to spend money on new technology, we need to show concrete value in efficiencies gained.

All of this will get sorted out. But it will take time.

Or maybe AI has been slow to take off because it simply isn’t that useful and AI optimists like TC are blinded by their own wildly inflated expectations. This parallels TC’s expectations that distance learning would eliminate all but a select handful of faculty, which, as seems clear now, was way off the mark.

What if it's the nature of the technology itself or the structure of the companies offering access to the technology? There's a very strong value/intelligence capture dynamic to both the technology and the service offerings that could be disrupting economic development. Open source might be the solution but there's probably also a strong IP component that is just missing. People want to be paid for their effort and LLMs are the ultimate plagiarizing freeloader.

It consistent with a view that we have been in a trend of "ever-more intelligent automation" since the industrial revolution. This is why we can extrapolate the line rather than having to posit some special singularity which is a departure from all human history.

I agree about the administrative bottlenecks, but I also tend to think many of the bottlenecks may be physical. Making self-driving cars is difficult without driving data. Similarly, making self-piloting interstellar spaceships is difficult without a large number of propulsion experiments built from a large number of custom facilities.

Lastly I would also point out the advent of super intelligence could mess without notions of what GDP growth is. If AI spends a lot of time exchanging information with itself, but the value of that information to the AI can be measured in some way compared to human products, than we may a reach a circumstance in which the vast majority of GDP is not only producing by AI but also represents AI consumption. Then we have to define something like a "human GDP" which is what we really expect to grow at a normal rate, even while the "AI GDP" can explode.

Tyler Cowen blames everything except for AI itself, thus ignoring common sense and some of the most famous economic papers of the 20th century. By this logic, we shouldn’t attribute either failure or success to a technology’s characteristics or capabilities. Does that make sense?

Griliches 1957 paper says otherwise. From the abstract; “Differences in the long-run equilibrium use of hybrid corn (ceilings) and in the rates of approach to that equilibrium (slopes) are explained, at least in part, by differences in the profitability of the shift from open pollinated to hybrid varieties in different parts of the country.” He empirically found that farmers with higher profits from the adoption of hybrid corn adopted it faster. Not at all surprising.

In his study of 12 different technologies in 1961, Edwin Mansfield says in the abstract: “This paper investigates the factors determining how rapidly the use of a new technique spreads from one firm to another.” In the

 conclusions: “This model is built largely around one hypothesis, that the probability that a firm will introduce a new technique is an increasing function of the proportion of firms already using it and the profitability of doing so, but a decreasing function of the size of the investment required.”

Mansfield comes to the same conclusion as Griliches, but with a much larger data set.

Yet Tyler Cowen claims that AI’s slow takeoff is not due to “the capabilities of AI models.”

What poor capability might be slowing the adoption of #AI? Two problems are certainly the continued low accuracies and high frequency of hallucinations, problems seen in anecdotal news stories and in references to experiments with AI.

Even a report from OpenAI provides us with the relevant facts. A January 31, 2025 PDF file from Open AI presents the following data in Table 3:

 GPT 4o-mini o1-mini 03-mini

 Accuracy (higher is better) 28% 20% 22%

 Hallucination rate (Lower is better) 52% 27% 15%

Accuracy should be rising and #hallucination rates should be falling. But they aren’t. And thus the benefits to users (i.e., companies) are lower than expected, and the AI takeoff is slower than expected.

Perhaps also worth noting is that there's been a very broad trend of bias against AI, some very reasonable, some not. A lot of people don't like how much it lowers cost of production on things like books, art, music, etc., allowing huge amounts of low-quality products to be created, and massively raising search costs when looking for good things. That bias shows up with things they don't like, obviously, but it is also attached to everything with the tag.

I think artificial intelligence generally speaking is as poorly defined and described and as overrated as human intelligence and especially so when it comes to societal benefit potential or real. I think they same thing about business "efficiency" and the overarching push to achieve it often at the expense of so many equally important values. Chewing your food slowly and savoring the tastes while talking nonsense with friends can be a wonderful experience. But you can more efficiently pump your body full of nutrients in 10 minutes and spend more time at work presumably maximizing your productivity and pushing up your small piece of the GDP or whatever biased measure of the economic good life you prefer. Numbers and machines are tools. Humans are flesh and blood and maybe a pacemaker or plastic hip joint so they can work harder and longer. I read in an Economist profile that you had some notion that people in Honduras got more happiness per paycheck than Americans, a form of efficiency I suppose, so I think you know what I'm talking about. I get your point that take-up on AI might be slower and less dramatic than some expect and I hope you are right because humans generally find a way to wring both the best and the worst from their inventions and it would be nice for a change to ease into AI in a way that gives us a chance to maybe figure out the worst and smother that much of it in the crib so to speak. Thanks for your posts. They make a person think.

What about economic/military competition between countries? If the likes of FDA overregulation and intransigent faculty members are all that stand between our world and radical transformation by AGI, won't some country opt to ram through these mostly self-imposed "bottlenecks" and achieve exceptional GDP growth rates? Then other countries will be forced to keep up or risk permanently losing their strategic position. Tyler's analysis seems correct as far as it goes, but doesn't touch on this idea of big-picture strategic competition, which might flip his conclusion.

It seems to me that you could make the exact same argument in 1700 that steam engines and machines are very unlikely to boost GDP growth past 0.1% per year, where it has sat for the past few centuries. As we know, human wages just don't scale that fast with strength and speed, suggesting that more mechanical power doesn't raise productivity dramatically. And O-Ring models suggest mechanical looms will be hard to work with. Maybe mechanical looms can churn out cotton fabrics thousands of times faster and more efficiently than humans, but humans are still slow at knitting, so fabrics probably won't grow much as an industry. Where does the analogy break down? If you take seriously the idea that AIs will be orders of magnitude cheaper, faster, more reliable, and more scalable than humans are most economically valuable tasks today, it seems very hard to avoid the conclusion that things will be dramatically reshaped on short timescales.

Surprised no one has offered this up yet, but here is ChatGPT 4’s analysis of the post, when prompted “what are the flaws in this argument?” Offered without comment…

“The argument presents several reasons why AI might not lead to a rapid economic growth boom. However, there are some key weaknesses in the reasoning:

 1. Baumol’s Cost Disease Argument is Overstated: While some sectors, like government and education, may be slow to adopt AI, this does not mean AI-driven growth will be slow overall. Historically, technology has found ways to work around bottlenecked sectors. AI may lead to major efficiency gains even in “slow” sectors through automation of bureaucracy, personalized education, and more efficient regulation. Additionally, many high-productivity sectors (finance, logistics, healthcare) are already integrating AI, suggesting it can drive economic gains even if some sectors lag.

 2. Human Bottlenecks Are Not Static: The argument assumes regulatory and adoption bottlenecks will remain fixed constraints. However, history shows that when a technology offers sufficiently large benefits, pressure builds to overcome bottlenecks. If AI dramatically increases drug discovery, public demand and competition could push the FDA to streamline approvals. Similarly, workplace resistance to AI could be mitigated by labor shortages and competitive pressures.

 3. O-Ring Model May Not Be the Best Analogy: The O-Ring model applies in contexts where a single weak link dramatically lowers productivity, but AI may not fit this dynamic. AI is already being designed to work around human limitations, often replacing or augmenting human decision-making rather than being constrained by the slowest human. Many tasks where AI shines (data analysis, automation, creative assistance) do not require every worker to be an expert.

 4. IQ-Wages Gradient and AI Productivity: The claim that AI’s intelligence won’t translate to massive productivity gains because human IQ has only a modest effect on wages ignores a crucial distinction: AI is not merely “higher IQ”; it is qualitatively different in capabilities. Unlike human intelligence, AI can scale rapidly, work continuously, and be replicated at near-zero marginal cost, which could lead to nonlinear productivity increases.

 5. Mischaracterization of Economic Models: While standard economic models may not perfectly predict AI’s impact, that does not mean AI-driven growth will necessarily be slow. The comparison to Star Trek technology appearing in our backyard suggests a lack of understanding of how quickly AI is already integrating into major industries. Previous technological revolutions, like electricity and computing, took time, but they ultimately reshaped the economy in ways that traditional models struggled to predict.

 6. Diffusion of Technology Argument is Selective: The argument selectively cites historical technology diffusion but ignores examples of rapid adoption. The internet, smartphones, and industrial automation spread far faster than electricity. AI, given its digital nature and scalability, may follow a much faster adoption curve than slower-moving physical technologies.

 7. Historical GDP Stability Doesn’t Prove AI Won’t Accelerate Growth: While past GDP growth has been relatively stable, this does not mean it must remain so. Technological revolutions, including the Industrial Revolution and computing, have driven significant long-term productivity gains. AI could be another such inflection point, and assuming continuity without strong justification is a weak argument.

 8. Current Market Prices Are Not Perfect Predictors: The claim that markets are not pricing in rapid transformation ignores the fact that markets often fail to anticipate technological shifts. Investors were skeptical about early computing, the internet, and even Tesla’s long-term potential. Market prices reflect short-term expectations and risk aversion, not necessarily the long-term trajectory of transformative technology.

Conclusion:

The argument makes reasonable points about adoption barriers, but it underestimates the flexibility of economies to adapt, the unique advantages of AI, and the historical precedent of rapid technological shifts. While AI’s impact on GDP growth may be uncertain, the case for a slow rollout is not as strong as suggested.“
