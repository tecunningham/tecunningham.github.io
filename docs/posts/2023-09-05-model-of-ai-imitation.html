<div class="page-columns page-full"><p><strong>If we train AIs to <em>imitate</em> humans, will they ever <em>beat</em> humans?</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are trained to predict what humans would say in a given situation (with some qualifications, see below). It would seem to follow that such a model would never be <em>better</em> at answering questions than a human.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In addition many other ML models are trained on human-generated labels, instead of any deeper ground truth: image recognition, language understanding, text classification, medical diagnosis. Thus we might expect computers to hit a ceiling once they achieve human ability.</p></li></div></div>
<p><strong>The question seems important.</strong> AI has caught up to human performance on many benchmarks, largely by imitating humans, it seems important to know whether this is a ceiling or we should expect them to shoot out ahead of us. Will LLMs be able to write superhumanly-persuasive prose? Will image models be able to see things in photos that we cannot? There is a lot of technical literature on imitation learning in AI but I haven’t found much discussion of this point.</p>
<p><strong>In a formal model I derive five mechanisms by which imitative AI can beat humans.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Noise.</strong> Different humans give different answers to a question, and so if an LLM can consistently give the average answer it will do better than the average human (the error of the average being always smaller than the average of the error).</li>
<li><strong>Specialization.</strong> People tend to write about what they know, and so an LLM which learns to predict the typical answer to a given question will sound like a specialist in all areas: it will answer questions about water like a hydrologist and questions about bugs like an entomologist (although it will also answer questions about astrology like an astrologist).</li>
<li><strong>Interpolation.</strong> An LLM will interpolate responses from different humans, and this interpolation can be functionally equivalent to inference, meaning an LLM will sometimes be able to reliably answer questions that <em>no</em> human can answer.</li>
<li><strong>Priors.</strong> If an LLM has different priors than a human then they could uncover hidden structure that humans do not, e.g.&nbsp;an LLM trained on human observations of astronomical events could conceivably recover cycles in those events, and so give superior predictions to the human.</li>
<li><strong>Tacit knowledge.</strong> The majority of human knowledge is tacit, meaning it is used in forming judgments but we do not have conscious access to that knowledge. If AI models can accurately predict human judgments then the weights in those models effectively contain that tacit knowledge, and so the model can be re-engineered to use that knowledge in ways that humans cannot.</li>

<section id="graphical-argument" class="level1">
<h1>Graphical Argument</h1>
<p>Here I illustrate all the core points in a graphical framework. For simplicity I am representing a set of questions and answers which can be represented by a pair of numbers, e.g.&nbsp;asking what is elevation of a point along a given line of latitude? I treat the human and the computer as having smooth priors about the world which determines how they interpolate and extrapolate from their observations.</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_cd6ac910ccfb0bfd725ff88d3bc0f908">

<p><img src="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>(1) Let the curve above represent the truth about the world.</strong> Each question about the world is a point on the x-axis, and the answer to each question is represented by the curve.</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_7204c08ebe9b78b3423d9b17f6a899f7">

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>(2) A human forms beliefs about the world (red curve).</strong> The human asks two questions and gets two answers (red dots) and from these they form estimates of the answer to every other question (red line).</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_80a5edaf08464c4722e191b91e501c7b">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>(3) A computer learns to predict the human’s answers (green curve).</strong> The human records some questions and their answers (green dots), and the computer learns to predict the human’s answers (green curve). Here I have illustrated a very favorable case, where the human has shared all her observations with the computer, and both the human and computer have the same priors. If the human gives inconsistent answers (imagine a thickening of the green line) then the computer will do better than the human by having less noise (the error of the average always being smaller than the average error).</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_e5741c55e6e493407ab90eb0e533daae">

<p><img src="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>(4) Add another human (blue curve).</strong> Suppose we have an additional human who asks some different questions (blue dots) and so forms different beliefs (blue line). Both humans’ beliefs are are accurate in the neighborhood of their own experience.</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_d5cf86154779593a708a8c13391a1dbc">

<p><img src="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>(5) Let the computer predict answers from both humans (green curve).</strong> Now both humans record their experiences and the computer tries to predict human answers (green curve). Here we can see:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Specialization.</strong> The computer’s predictions can match the humans’ responses in each of their domains of expertise</li>
<li><strong>Interpolation.</strong> The computer is better than <em>both</em> humans in the intermediate region, i.e.&nbsp;the computer effectively combines information from both humans.</li>
</ol>
<div class="cell" data-hash="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_03f3e315bf3dbd84aa7afec856a125fb">

<p><img src="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>(6) Let the computer have superior priors.</strong> If the computer and human have different priors then they will make different extrapolations from the same dataset. Suppose the world has a strong cyclical structure, as shown in the black oscillating line. The human does not appreciate the regularity and fits their datapoints with a simple nearest-neighbor algorithm, but the computer, with different priors, could get a superior fit to the true model. A simple hypothetical: suppose we trained a language model to predict records of astronomical observations, it could conceivably discover cycles in these observations even if no human was aware of those cycles, such that computer predictions of out-of-sample human observations of the world would constitute super-human predictions about the world.</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_b4cc24ee0e5acacef3af5eac7a342101">

<p><img src="2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>(7) Let the human have tacit knowledge.</strong> Finally, suppose the human always knows correct the answer when they see the question (red), but their conscious understanding of the relationship (pink) is imperfect. When asked abstract questions about the world they cannot use their tacit knowledge, e.g.&nbsp;if asked what is the maximum of this function they would choose the maximum of the pink curve (conscious beliefs), not the red curve (tacit beliefs). However the computer could learn the tacit knowledge from observing sufficiently many answers, and then algorithmically find the maximum of this curve, substantially outperforming the human at these abstract questions.</p>

<section id="five-reasons-for-superhuman-performance" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Five Reasons for Superhuman Performance</h1>
<p><strong>(1) Noise.</strong> For many tasks there is very high within-human and between-human variation, so any model which is deterministic will have a substantial advantage. Thus averaging multiple answers tends to do much better (the “wisdom of crowds”, and the “crowd within”). A computer with a deterministic outcome will thus have a substantial advantage.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Specialization.</strong> We can see clear evidence of specialization in LLMs: they will answer questions about fish like an icthyologist, and questions about Ukraine like a Ukrainian. There is a nice discussion of this with many examples by <a href="https://ryxcommar.com/2023/03/28/chatgpt-as-a-query-engine-on-a-giant-corpus-of-text/">ryxcommar</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“When you ask ChatGPT a more intelligent question, you get a more intelligent answer. Just like how you ask ChatGPT a more Spanish question, you get a more Spanish answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>This works very well as long as the people who talk most about a topic tend to be the people who are most knowledgeable about that topic. If the reverse was true then AI would perform worse than the average person. In some cases it does seem to be true that the people who are most talkative are the least accurate, e.g.&nbsp;for conspiracy theories, politically partisan issues, or pseudosciences.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Thus we can predict that asking an LLM about these issues will tend to give low-quality answers, and indeed if you ask GPT-4 “what are some characteristics of Virgoes?” it will give a quite factual answer listing the traits of Virgoes.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Analogically, in music or visual art, there might be some genres where the people who create artworks are uniquely bad at it, and so in these genres imitative AI would learn to make artworks worse than the average human would make.</p></li><li id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;As of Oct 2023.</p></li></div></div>
<p><strong>(3) Interpolation.</strong> I have not yet come up with a crisp question which an LLM can accurately answer but no human can, however there are <em>tasks</em> which LLMs can perform which it likely no human can perform without help:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recent LLMs (e.g.&nbsp;GPT, Bard) can transpose styles very easily, e.g.&nbsp;writing a Shakespearean sonnet about a particular episode of a particular television show, which arguably cannot be done by any human being.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<p>In fact there is a literature from the 1950s showing that computers with linear regression models do better than humans in learning to predict from novel datasets, and indeed better than experts in making clinical judgments using a small number of cues (<span class="citation" data-cites="camerer1991processperformance">Camerer and Johnson (<a href="#ref-camerer1991processperformance" role="doc-biblioref">1991</a>)</span>). This is surprising because it took an additional 70 years for computers to catch up with human ability in making many other judgments. I think the key difference is that the 1950s results apply to low-dimensional cases (<span class="math inline">\(p&lt;n\)</span>), while only recently have we taught computers to deal with high-dimensional data (<span class="math inline">\(p\gg n\)</span>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t know of any clear-cut examples which show an LLM outperforming a human because of superior priors. Here is a hypothetical: suppose the training data of an LLM included a large set of scientific observations, and those observations contain some underlying pattern which was not recognized by any contemporary scientist. If you ask the LLM about the existence of patterns then it should answer like a scientist and say there is no known pattern. However if you ask the LLM to predict new observations then those predictions may obey the pattern, as a consequence the LLM could be used to systematically map out prediction, which may make it easier to identify the pattern. Thus you could imagine an LLM would correctly predict the position of the stars.</p>
<p>There is an interesting sublety in how the AI ought to be used:</p>
<p><strong>(5) Tacit Knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>The relative success of machine learning over symbolic AI has often been connected to the importance of tacit human knowledge, e.g.&nbsp;by Geoff Hinton. I have written a lot about the importance of tacit knowledge in human decision-making, especially <span class="citation" data-cites="cunningham2015hierarchical">Cunningham (<a href="#ref-cunningham2015hierarchical" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> and this <a href="https://tecunningham.github.io/posts/2017-12-10-unconscious-influences.html">post</a>, see also <span class="citation" data-cites="cunningham2022implicit">Cunningham and De Quidt (<a href="#ref-cunningham2022implicit" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>. In memory a related phenomenon is the “recognition recall” gap (<span class="citation" data-cites="macdougall1904recognition">MacDougall (<a href="#ref-macdougall1904recognition" role="doc-biblioref">1904</a>)</span>): people are significantly better at recognizing whether they saw a word before than in recalling that word.</p>
<p>In fact I think this is a reasonable description of image synthesis by neural nets: models are first trained to recognize images given captions, and then a new image can be synthesized to match a given caption, e.g.&nbsp;through a diffusion algorithm. Here there’s a striking asymmetry: algorithms can approximately match average human performance in recognition, but they far outperform human performance in construction of new artefacts.</p>

They say identify only a single benchmark where performance is not close to the human baseline, and most of the models they discuss are imitation learning. As a consequence some work has moved to evaluating models against examples specifically on “adversarial” tasks chosen to fool computers (e.g.&nbsp;Dynabench, <span class="citation" data-cites="kiela2021dynabench">Kiela et al.

<p><strong>On some benchmarks no computer could ever beat human performance.</strong> On some tasks human performance effectively <em>is</em> the ground truth, and so by definition computers could never beat humans. This is roughly true for text comprehension: a sentence has a given meaning if and only if the average person believes it has that meaning. When we observe computer outperformance it is because either (1) there is human variation and the computer output is more consistent; or (2) computers outperform amateur humans but the ground truth is expert humans.</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p><strong>We can formalize “superhuman” ability in a variety of ways.</strong> The notation is introduced more fully below, but briefly <span class="math inline">\(\bm{q}\)</span> represents a question, <span class="math inline">\(a(\bm{q})\)</span> represents the correct answer, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{a}(\bm{q})\)</span> represents the computer’s answer, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{a}_i(\bm{q})\)</span> represents the answer of human <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The expectations can be interpreted as over the universe of all questions, or some subset of questions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      \text{weak:}&amp;&amp;    \ut{E[(a(q)-\bar{a}(q))^2]}{error of computer}
         &amp;\leq  \ut{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^mE[(a(q)-\hat{a}_i(q))^2]}{avg error of human}\\
      \text{medium:}&amp;&amp;  \ut{E[(a(q)-\bar{a}(q))^2]}{error of computer}
         &amp;\leq  \ut{E\left[(a(q)-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^m\hat{a}_i(q))^2\right]}{error of avg human}\\
      \text{strong:}&amp;&amp;  \ut{E[(a(q)-\bar{a}(q))^2]}{error of computer}
         &amp;\leq  \ut{\min_{i=1,\ldots,m}E[(a(q)-\hat{a}_i(q))^2]}{error of best human}\\
      \text{super-strong:}&amp;&amp; \ut{E[(a(q)-\bar{a}(q))^2]}{error of computer}
         &amp;\leq  \ut{E[(\min_{i=1,\ldots,m}\{a(q)-\hat{a}_i(q)\})^2]}{error of best human by question}\\
   \end{aligned}\]</span> Note that we cannot rank benchmark #2 and #3: the error of the best human could be either higher or lower than the error of the average human.</p>
<p><strong>I will use “superhuman” to mean the AI can answer some question better than any human can.</strong> The most interesting question is whether AI can exhibit “super strong” superhuman performance. It seems clear that imitative learning can easily lead to superhuman performance by all the other 3 definitions through (1) reducing noise, and (2) combining expertise. However super-strong superhuman performance would require either (1) interpolation, (2) superior priors, or (3) using tacit human knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Training on custom-written answers (fine tuning).</strong> Recent LLMs don’t train just on predicting existing text (books, internet, twitter) they also use datasets of instructions and responses generated by paid raters (<span class="citation" data-cites="ouyang2022training">Ouyang et al. (<a href="#ref-ouyang2022training" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>). We can still call this imitation but it’s putting relatively more weight on imitating the responses of specific set of people, the paid raters. This fine-tuning significantly improves performance on most benchmarks but I think it also has costs: the model is now predicting output of a specific set of people (i.e.&nbsp;non-expert paid raters), and so conceivably will do less well at incorporating niche information available to an expert.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p><strong>Training on evaluation instead of production.</strong> Recent LLMs are not purely imitative, e.g.&nbsp;OpenAI’s GPT models are trained with human <em>evaluation</em> of their responses (called reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)), and they find that it dramatically increases performance on instruction-following benchmarks.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The key difference is that the goal now reflects how humans <em>rate</em> responses rather than how humans <em>generate</em> responses. In some domains the two functions might be identical but in others there’s a clear difference, I would argue that tacit knowledge is the core difference.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn9"><p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;E.g. see OpenAI’s 2022 InstructGPT (<span class="citation" data-cites="ouyang2022training">Ouyang et al. (<a href="#ref-ouyang2022training" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>). In fact they run reinforcement learning against a model trained to predict the human evaluation of outputs, and other papers run reinforcement learning against LLM-produced evaluations, RLAIF (<span class="citation" data-cites="lee2023rlaif">Lee et al. (<a href="#ref-lee2023rlaif" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>).</p></li></div></div>
<p><strong>Other discussion of super-human performance by LLMs.</strong> I have found surprisingly little online or academic discussion about whether LLMs will hit a ceiling defined by human performance. A good paper by <span class="citation" data-cites="bowman2023eight">Bowman (<a href="#ref-bowman2023eight" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> has a section titled “human performance on a task isn’t an upper bound on LLM performance.” He says LLMs can outperform humans for two reasons: (1) “they are trained on far more data than any human sees,” and (2) “they are often given additional training using reinforcement learning … which trains them to produce responses that humans find helpful without requiring humans to demonstrate such helpful behavior.” I think these correspond to two of the five reasons I identified (specialization and tacit knowledge).</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p><strong>For some tasks human-level performance is the ceiling by definition.</strong> The ground truth about language interpretation is humans interpretation, and so it is hard to see how a computer could exhibit superhuman performance (in the super-strong sense).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> In benchmarks for natural language understanding the labels are typically written by the human authors of the benchmark, so it would be impossible to observe superhuman performance (<span class="citation" data-cites="tedeschi2023s">Tedeschi et al. (<a href="#ref-tedeschi2023s" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>). A similar point applies to content moderation the definition of ground truth is typically either majority-vote among paid human raters, or the reflective judgment of a senior human employee, thus a computer could only outperform in the weak senses above.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn10"><p><sup>10</sup>&nbsp;There are exceptions but I don’t think they are quantitatively important. Consider the a sentence like “Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.” This sentence has at least one well-defined meaning according to the typical rules of English but arguably no human would correctly identify that meaning unless specifically prompted. A computer trained only on human comprehension, i.e.&nbsp;data which did not contain such outlier sentences, could plausibly identify its meaning.</p></li><li id="fn11"><p><sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Many recent language models do outperform the average human baseline on language understanding tasks, but <span class="citation" data-cites="tedeschi2023s">Tedeschi et al. (<a href="#ref-tedeschi2023s" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> argue that for a variety of reasons the strength of these results is significantly exaggerated.</p></li></div></div>
<p></p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p><strong>Computers can outperform humans on recognition tasks.</strong> Most benchmarks for media recognition use human labels, e.g.&nbsp;for object detection in photos or speech recognition in audio. However humans can be mistaken: they might incorrectly think a photo has a dog in it when it does not or vice versa. Humans are very good at recognition, so human-labelled data has been sufficient, but computers are liable to exceed human performance on these tasks.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn12"><p><sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Defining the ground truth in a recognition task is somewhat complicated because a given set of pixels is consistent with an infinite variety of objects causing that arrangement, we are able to talk about an image representing an object in the context of strong priors about the world. So the ground truth of interest must be something like “in ordinary circumstances, what is the probability that these pixels would be caused by a scene with a dog in them.”</p></li></div></div>
<p><strong>The graphical model underplays the importance of model architecture.</strong> The graphical model shown above represents both questions and answers as unidimensional, and it makes it seem that a small sample is sufficient to get a reasonably good approximation of the true function. In reality the questions are very high dimensional and most architectures fail to get a good fit. Neural nets, especially those with a transformer structure, have had remarkable success in fitting the data, leading to leaps in performance.</p>
<p><strong>AI could be used to create super-human artefacts.</strong> There has been a lot of discussion about whether AI be used to exceed human abilities to create certain artefacts, e.g.&nbsp;hyper-beautiful paintings, hyper-addictive clickbait, hyper-persuasive text. Using the existing architecture of LLMs, which predict human outputs, this is unlikely: they might be able to predict the objects that a very talented human would produce, but would not surpass their ability. However AI could be used to generate artfeacts indirectly: instead of predicting how a human would create such an arfect, the weights that the AI has learned could be used to find the artefact which maximizes the function of interest, e.g.&nbsp;hyper-persuasive, or hyper-beautiful. In this way the AI could create artefacts beyond the ability of any human. This is roughly how image synthesis algorithms work: after training a model to recognize images, new images can be created by maximizing the learned weights.</p>
<p><strong>Economic implication: imitative AI brings everybody to the knowledge frontier.</strong> An imitative LLM can effectively serve as a consultant: it will tell you how a domain-expert would answer your question. For some problems we’ve already been able to do that for a long time, e.g.&nbsp;a textbook will tell you scientific advice on crop management practices, but LLMs allow for much subtler contingencies and to incorporate tacit knowledge. We should therefore expect the productivity impact of LLMs to be mainly on those who are behind the knowledge frontier, and we might also expect a compression of incomes. </p>

<p><strong>Venn diagram representation.</strong> This diagram shows an alternative way of representing some of the core claims: in general the questions answerable by an LLM will not be a subset of the questions answered in the training set, or even those answerable by the people who contributed to the training set. The Venn diagram’s disadvantage, relative to the visualizations above, is that it does not represent the mechanics of <em>why</em> the LLM can outperform humans, while the diagram above can be use to separately show five distinct reasons (averaging error, specialization, interpolation, different priors, and using tacit knowledge).</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p><strong>Imitation learning in dynamic problems.</strong> The discussion in this note has been about a purely static problem of supplying answers to questions, but text generation can also be considered as a dynamic problem of sequentially generating tokens. A common observation regarding dynamic policy is that pure prediction of expert behaviour (“behavioural cloning”) is not very robust, and this has been used to explain weaknesses in the behaviour of autoregressive generative text models.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn13"><p><sup>13</sup>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="cundy2023sequencematch">Cundy and Ermon (<a href="#ref-cundy2023sequencematch" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> say “[the] simple behaviour cloning approach results in a compounding error problem, where the further the trained model gets from the typical expert states, the worse the model performs, incurring increasing error.” I also found <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs237b/pdfs/lecture/cs237b_lecture_12.pdf">these notes</a> from Stanford’s CS273B useful.</p></li></div></div>

<p>I will assume that the number of unobserved weights is large relative to the human’s experience (<span class="math inline">\(p\gg n\)</span>), so the human will gradually learn more about reality as she observes the answer to more questions. She will be able to perfectly answer any question she’s seen before, but will never learn the full set of weights.</p>
<p><strong>Computer beliefs.</strong> Suppose that humans write down some set of questions, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Q}\)</span>, and then record their best guesses at the answers. These could be questions that the humans already know the answer to (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{Q}\subseteq Q\)</span>), or they could be new questions that they are guessing the answer to. We then use those questions and answers to train a computer, and the computer likewise assumes a linear model with i.i.d. Gaussian weights. Note that the computer is being trained to predict human responses, not to predict properties of the world. We can write the computer-estimated weights as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      \hat{\bm{a}}        &amp;= \hat{Q}\hat{\bm{w}}
         &amp;&amp; \text{(human-generated questions \&amp; answers)}\\
      \bar{\bm{w}} &amp;= \hat{Q}'(\hat{Q}\hat{Q}')^{-1}\hat{\bm{a}}
         &amp;&amp; \text{(computer estimate of human weights $\hat{\bm{w}}$)}
   \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Computer answers.</strong> Finally we can ask the computer a new question, <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{q}\)</span>, and observe its answer: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      \tilde{a}        &amp;= \tilde{\bm{q}}'\bar{\bm{w}}
         &amp;&amp; \text{(computer answer to a novel question $\tilde{\bm{q}}$)}\\

<section id="model-implications" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-implications">Model Implications</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>If one human records all their observations then the computer will perfectly imitate them.</strong></dt>
<dd>
Suppose that there is one human and they write down all of their observations, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Q}=Q\)</span>. Because the computer and human have the same priors, and observe the same data, then they will therefore end up with the same estimated weights (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\bm{w}}=\bar{\bm{w}}\)</span>), and so the computer will answer every question exactly as the human does, though neither knows the truth (<span class="math inline">\(\bar{\bm{w}}\neq\bm{w}\)</span>).
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>If humans are noisy then the computer will outperform them.</strong> Suppose humans report their answers with some i.i.d. noise <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. If the computer observes sufficiently many answers for each question then the noise will be washed out and they will outperform.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>If humans record a subset of their observation then the computer will perform worse.</strong></dt>
<dd>
Suppose humans only write down some of their observations, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\hat{Q}\)</span> is a row-wise subset of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Then computers and humans will give the same answers for any question in the training set, but outside of that set computers will generally do worse than humans. And so for any question <span class="math inline">\(\bm{q}\not\in\hat{Q}\)</span> the computer will do worse in expectation: <span class="math display">\[E[\ut{(\bm{q}(\bm{w}-\bar{\bm{w}}))^2}{computer error}]\geq
     E[\ut{(\bm{q}(\bm{w}-\hat{\bm{w}}))^2}{human error}].\]</span> Note that we are fixing the question <span class="math inline">\(\bm{q}\)</span> and taking the expectation over all possible worlds, <span class="math inline">\(\bm{w}\)</span>. I think you could probably rewrite this such that, in the world we are in, we should observe worse average performance across a set of questions, but I think you’d need to add some conditions to make sure that the questions are sufficiently independent (e.g.&nbsp;if there was a single weight <span class="math inline">\(w_q\)</span> which dominated all the other weights then the computer might beat the human by accident).
</dd>
<dt><strong>If there are two humans then the computer will outperform them both.</strong></dt>
<dd>
Suppose there are two humans who each observe answers to different question, <span class="math inline">\(Q_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_B\)</span>, and they both write them all down, so <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}=(\smallmatrix{Q_A\\Q_B})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\bm{a}}=(\smallmatrix{Q_A\bm{w}\\Q_B\bm{w}})\)</span>. Now the computer clearly has superior information to either human, and so if we let <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\bm{w}}(i)\)</span> represent the weights of human <span class="math inline">\(i\in\{A,B\}\)</span>, then for any question <span class="math inline">\(\bm{q}\)</span> we can write: <span class="math display">\[E[\ut{(\bm{q}(\bm{w}-\bar{\bm{w}}))^2}{computer error}]\leq
  E[\ut{(\bm{q}(\bm{a}-\hat{\bm{w}}(i)))^2}{human error}].\]</span>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>If there are multiple humans then the computer can answer question no human can answer.</strong> Suppose two humans observe the answers to the following questions: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      Q_A &amp;= \bmatrix{1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1} \\
      Q_B &amp;= \bmatrix{1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1}
   \end{aligned}\]</span> The first human will learn the exact value of <span class="math inline">\(w_2\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{w}_2=w_2\)</span>), and the second human will learn the exact value of <span class="math inline">\(w_3\)</span>, but neither will learn both values, and so neither could predict the answer to this question with perfect confidence: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      \tilde{q} &amp;= \bmatrix{1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1} \\
   \end{aligned}\]</span> However if they both recorded their observations, so the computer observes <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\bm{a}}=(\smallmatrix{Q_1\bm{w}\\Q_2\bm{w}})\)</span>, the computer will be able to infer both <span class="math inline">\(w_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w_3\)</span>, and thus will be able to perfectly answer <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{q}\)</span>. We can see this behaviour in LLMs: they sometimes combine a pair of facts or a pair of abilities which no single human has access to, e.g.&nbsp;when an LLM translates between two languages, for which there exists no human speaker of both.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p><strong>If humans write outside their expertise then the computer will do worse.</strong> In the cases above we assumed that the two humans recorded only what they directly observed, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Q}\subseteq Q\)</span>. This means the computer essentially had a window directly to the world. However the humans could instead have written down their estimated answers to other questions. Suppose both humans wrote down answers to every possible question, <span class="math inline">\(\bm{q}\in\{-1,1\}^p\)</span>, then we could conjecture that the computer would learn the average of the two humans’ weights:<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span class="math display">\[\bar{\bm{w}}=\frac{1}{2}\hat{\bm{w}}_A+\frac{1}{2}\hat{\bm{w}}_B.\]</span> Here the computer will do worse than the two humans on the original questions, <span class="math inline">\(Q_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_B\)</span>. The implication is that LLMs work so well only because people tend to write about what they know. Put another way, when an LLM answers a question, it will not predict the answer given by the average person, but will predict the answer given by people who are likely to answer that question in the real world, and luckily those people tend to be people who are subject-matter experts.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn15"><p><sup>15</sup>&nbsp;We would have to augment the computer’s learning rule to allow for noise in answers - I need to confirm that the weighting will be exactly 1/2.</p></li></div></div>
<p><strong>If humans have tacit knowledge, then computers can outperform in choosing a question to maximize the answer.</strong> We can model tacit knowledge with two separate sets of human weights: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      \hat{\bm{w}}^T   &amp;= \text{tacit knowledge}\\
      \hat{\bm{w}}^E &amp;= \text{explicit knowledge}\\
   \end{aligned}\]</span> When the human encounters a new question <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\bm{q}}\)</span> they will use their tacit knowledge to form an estimate of the answer, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{a}=\tilde{\bm{q}}'\hat{\bm{w}}^T\)</span>. But they have limited ability to introspect about that capacity, and so when asked how they make their judgments they can report only <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\bm{w}}^E\)</span>. For simplicity assume tacit knowledge is perfect (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\bm{w}}^T=\bm{w}\)</span>), and explicit knowledge is imperfect (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\bm{w}}^E=\bm{w}\)</span>).</p>
<p>The distinction becomes important when we want to create a new question. Here it’s useful to interpret <span class="math inline">\(\bm{q}\)</span> not as a question but as an artefact, e.g.&nbsp;a text or image, and interpret <span class="math inline">\(a=\bm{q}'\bm{w}\)</span> as a property of that artefact, e.g.&nbsp;how persuasive is the text, or how attractive is the image. Suppose we want to choose <span class="math inline">\(\bm{q}\in\{-1,1\}^n\)</span> to maximize <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. If we had perfect access to our beliefs <span class="math inline">\(\bm{w}^T\)</span> this would be simple, however if we have access only to imperfect explicit knowledge <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\bm{w}}^E\)</span>, the artefact which maximizes that function will not generally be the one which maximizes <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. This represents an asymmetry in human cognition: we can recognize certain patterns (whether text is persuasive, whether a picture is pretty), without being able to produce those patterns.</p>
<p>Here the computer model is less constrained. Suppose the computer has observed sufficiently many questions such that they have perfectly learned human tacit knowledge, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\bm{w}}=\hat{\bm{w}}^T\)</span>. If computation is costless we could query every single <span class="math inline">\(\bm{q}\in\{-1,1\}^p\)</span> to find the highest <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. More realistically we could use a diffusion algorithm, or reinforcement learning against human or computer evaluation, to find an artefact with a high <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</p>

<section id="additional-observations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-observations">Additional Observations</h2>
<p>These are a few miscellaneous results additional results that helped me with intuition for the working of this model.</p>
<p><strong>With one observation and two weights.</strong> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(n=1, p=2\)</span>, then we have: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      Q  &amp;= \bmatrix{q_1 &amp; q_2} \\
      \bm{a}'  &amp;= \bmatrix{a} \\
      \bm{w}'  &amp;= \bmatrix{w_1 &amp; w_2 } \\
      \Sigma &amp;= \bmatrix{\sigma_1^2 &amp; \rho \\ \rho &amp; \sigma_2^2}\\
      \Sigma Q' &amp;= \bmatrix{ \sigma_1^2q_1 + \rho q_2 \\ \rho q_1 + \sigma_2^2 q_2 } \\
      Q\Sigma Q' &amp;= \bmatrix{ \sigma_1^2q_1^2 + 2\rho q_1q_2 + \sigma_2^2 q_2^2} \\
      \hat{\bm{w}}=\Sigma Q'(Q\Sigma Q')^{-1}\bm{a}
         &amp;= \bmatrix{ \frac{\sigma_1^2q_1 + \rho q_2}{\sigma_1^2q_1^2 + 2\rho q_1q_2 + \sigma_2^2 q_2^2} \\
                  \frac{\rho q_1 + \sigma_2^2 q_2}{\sigma_1^2q_1^2 + 2\rho q_1q_2 + \sigma_2^2 q_2^2}} a
   \end{aligned}
   \]</span></p>
<p>We can normalize <span class="math inline">\(q_1=q_2=1\)</span>, then we have: <span class="math display">\[\hat{w}_1 = \frac{\sigma_1^2+\rho}{\sigma_1^2+2\rho+\sigma_2^2}a,\]</span> Here we are dividing up responsibility for the answer (<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>) into the contributions of each component, nice and simple.</p>
<p><strong>With two observations and one weight.</strong> Here we’re <em>over-identified</em>. <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      Q  &amp;= \bmatrix{q^1 \\ q^2} \\
      \bm{a}  &amp;= \bmatrix{a^1 \\ a^2} \\
      \bm{w}  &amp;= \bmatrix{w } \\
      \Sigma &amp;= \bmatrix{\sigma^2 }\\
      \Sigma Q' &amp;= \bmatrix{ \sigma^2 q^1 &amp; \sigma^2 q^2 } \\
      Q\Sigma Q' &amp;= \bmatrix{ \sigma^2 q^1q^1 &amp; \sigma^2q^1q^2 \\ \sigma^2q^1q^2 &amp; \sigma^2q^2q^2}
         &amp;&amp; \text{(this matrix doesn't have an inverse)}
   \end{aligned}
   \]</span></p>
<p><strong>With noise.</strong> Suppose we only observe the answers with random noise, then we get this: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   \ut{\bm{a}}{$m\times1$}   &amp;= \ut{Q}{$m\times n$}\ut{\bm{w}}{$n\times1$}
      + \ut{\bm{e}}{$n\times 1$} \\
   \bm{e} &amp;\sim N(\bm{0},s^2I_m) &amp;&amp; \text{(i.i.d. noise w variance $s^2$)}\\
   Cov(\bm{w},\bm{a})   &amp;= \Sigma Q' \\
   Var(\bm{a}) &amp;= Q\Sigma Q' + s^2I_m \\
   E[\bm{w}|Q,\bm{q}]   &amp;= \Sigma Q'(Q\Sigma Q' + s^2I_m)^{-1}\bm{a}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Compare to Bayesian linear regression.</strong> We can compare this result to Bayesian linear regression (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_linear_regression">Wikipedia</a>): <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
      \bar{\beta}  &amp;= \Sigma Q'(Q\Sigma Q' + s^2I_m)^{-1}\bm{a}
         &amp;&amp; \text{(our result)} \\
      \tilde{\beta} &amp;= (Q'Q+s^{2}\Sigma^{-1})^{-1}Q'\bm{a}
         &amp;&amp; \text{(Bayesian linear regression)}\\
   \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>I <em>believe</em> that these can be shown to be equivalent by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_matrix_identity">matrix inversion lemma</a>, though I haven’t confirmed this. There’s a <a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1212&amp;context=ece_facpub">note online</a> that appears to show equivalence.</p>
