<p>I talked to David up in Napa about doing a rotation.</p>
<p>David says: will the work on research be as impactful as the work you’d otherwise be doing on analytics.</p>
<p>Policy Research Offsite:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If OpenAI continues its pattern of releasing a GPT model every 12-18 months, we can expect GPT-5 in fall 2024, GPT-6 in early 2026, and GPT-7 by late 2027. Given org timelines that project AGI by 2027, we are potentially just 1-3 deployments away.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“To put it another way, if this is our penultimate offsite before AGI, what infrastructure do we need to put in place now to ensure that only final adjustments are left for the next final offsite?</p>

<p><strong>Expensive but drab.</strong> Fancy hotel, winery, restaurant. Everything expensive but drab, perfunctory. The hotel was new but with an old wooden staircase. The winery was new, they talked about how it’s LEED certified, how the dining table is a rescued church door from a hurricane, and the insulation is from blue jeans. / The staff everywhere with forced enthusiasm. The winery guide said she shouldn’t really be telling us this, or saying she shouldn’t really be giving us this wine, but will anyway.</p>
<p>Eric R arranged a party bus to take us up.</p>
<p><strong>Personality test.</strong> three poles: - Red: achieving things - Blue: people/compassion - Green: analysis</p>
<p>My answers were equally balanced, I was in the center. But then everyone else has to assess your personality. On my back the answers clustered between Red and Green, one person put me deep blue.</p>
<p><strong>Groups were right.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Group: EricR, EricK, myself, Yilin. It’s true the 3 of us will have strong opinions and push for them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Each person introducing themselves.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Eric R:</em> from Seattle but he says his life started in Pomona.</li>
<li><em>Eric K:</em> Ohio. 18 months in Bhutan, after maths at Northwestern.</li>
<li><em>Rob:</em> started dancing at Pomona. His mother a book curator in DC.</li>
<li><em>David:</em> grew up in Santa Cruz, says he was a stoner at Berkeley studying cognitive science. He travelled with his girlfriend, was thinking of starting a business importing peppercorns from India. Saw people in India using Facebook on their flip phones, joined FB. His father is 3rd generation Japanese-American. He had tried to find ancestors in Japan but unsuccessfully.</li>
<li><em>Paul.</em> Ohio, Cincinatti. Moved home after college to help look after his sister’s children. He’s in many choirs because of his low voice.</li>
<li><em>Yilin</em> Her parents architects, sent her to US to study architecture, but she switched to computer science. Did a masters, went to a gaming company.</li>
<li><em>Michael</em> - missionary in Japan then worked in Canada speaking Japanese. Some kind of engineering, worked for Canadian telcom, slowly got into data engineering.</li>
<li><em>Alex</em> – stayed in Santa Barbara working for some kind of finance company.</li>
<li><em>Victoria</em> – Michigan, MIT. Soccer referee in school, she says she was better at refereeing than at playing soccer. She says it was good preparation for working as data science, because also relatively few women referees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion about the group.</strong></p>
<p><em>Victoria saying she’s working too fast</em> – only able to do shallow analyses, not doing big picture or building growth accounting table.</p>
<p><em>Whether we need better data.</em> Eric K saying we need better data for reporting ; I say actually we’re not constrained on quality of data for reporting. We already know most of these things , but we need to put them together in a coherent framework. Rob says we didn’t even know if 4 was profitable because we hadn’t been counting the gpus, I said more important than that.</p>

<p><strong>Talk with Zoe Hitzig.</strong></p>
<pre><code>  She said she's going to be working on aligning preferences. E.g. how to distribute fairly without ads. Perhaps pay people for their data.

  I said working in industry it's useful to have a theory of how leaders make decisions (Zuckerberg, Musk, Altman), the difference between their stated and actual goals.

  I said that we shouldn't be too dismissive of ads, that mass media has been running for a century and a half on advertising, it's got all sorts of pathologies but it's a way of funding non-excludable technologies.

  I said that paying people for their data can be a bit dangerous. In social media many times platforms have messed up the intrinsic motivation of their users -- if you pay people for their contributions then they'll contribute less.

  I said the company doesn't really have any plans at longer horizon than 3-6 months.</code></pre>

<p>“First ask questions”: puberty suppression for gender-related distress</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>An editorial in the Dutch Medical Journal last year called for dialogue: primum rogare, first ask questions. The seminar is an opportunity to pose questions about the practice of “gender affirming health care” for children and young people with gender dysphoria or incongruence. Specifically, to examine prescription of hormones to suppress puberty (Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone agonists) in New Zealand since 2011, and to consider the rationale for their use.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There are sharply divergent views on this practice and some believe even asking questions poses a risk of harm in this sensitive area. Yet medicine is a moral practice and the norms of openness in science must apply. I will examine the arguments put forward by advocates for use of puberty blocking hormones. I will also examine the arguments of those who advise caution, informed by the just released Cass Review into gender identity services for children and young people in England. In discussing these matters I will consider the Medical Council Standards in relation to: prescribing a medicine for an unapproved indication, assessing the patient’s condition before prescribing, practicing in the patient’s best interests, assessing capacity to give consent, and providing balanced information. I will also consider a child’s right to an open future.</p>

<h1>2024-05-10 | friday</h1>
<p><strong>Working from the garage today.</strong> Actually it’s a real joy to be here at the desk pounding some things out: comfortable chair.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah Li talk at BATES.</strong> Disappointing talk, it was just an experiment on MTurk showing that people did things that it was in their interests to do. About how people interact with algorithms strategically – they choose to engage with things with a belief about how it’ll influence the future algorithm’s response.</p>
<p><strong>Dinner at a Greek restaurant.</strong> Rose, Nico, Guido, Hannah. Retsina, octopus, feta. Guido always seems a little uninterested and a little impatient yet he still keeps coming to these dinners. Nico.</p>
<p><strong>Nico about applied science at Meta.</strong> He says they had a very rough year after the layoffs. Everyone unhappy and it made them very conservative about their work. They were all very anxious about their jobs, and so they would only do very conservative projects. They would only do projects that they could get credit for, so they wouldn’t lose their jobs. He said that the front end teams would not want to share credit with the back end teams, so they would not want to work with them.</p>
<p><strong>Took a lift from Nico.</strong> He has a huge engaging smile, he’s also generous and clumsy.</p>
<p><strong>Guido at Amazon.</strong> He says he meets with many teams who bring their problems to him, it’s like office hours. Most of the time it’s about designing experiments that get at some variable, or non-experimental inference.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah Li.</strong> She’s just started teaching operations &amp; management at columbia, or just about to start teaching. Nico used to be in the same department.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah Li hesitation about optimization:</strong> she’s reading a book about how optimization has harmed the world, how it’s made it more brittle somehow. She described examples but seemed a bit unclear whether they really were wrong in context. Something about optimizing crop yields and GM food, had made crops more fragile I think.</p>
<p><strong>I talked about premature optimization.</strong></p>

<p>Oaxaca food truck: atole memelitas Oaxacan empanadas huarache.</p>
<p>In the morning Citlali hit her head while she was bouncing around on the bed downstairs. Lynn and Yolanda fussing over her, she was crying and called out “I want papi.” I lay down on the bed and snuggled with her, she calmed down &amp; said that she was frustrated because Lynn and Yolanda kept asking her about it &amp; she didn’t want to talk about it. I said OK &amp; we started talking about other things. Lynn and Yolanda kept passing by and asking Citlali about her head – unnecessary things, asking her how did it happen, or why was she so sensitive about it – &amp; making her cry once again.</p>
<p>Two things on Sunday:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Getting back in the car Lynn said I shouldn’t drive, because I had scratched the hub when I parked. I hadn’t scratched the hub, I’d hit the curb with the tyre, it was some fantasy somehow Bruno had imagined it &amp; then Lynn got the idea. I said OK who should drive then, obviously a bit irritated. Lynn got confused. I drived.</p></li>
<li><p>On the drive home another car almost hit me. Lynn said to Bruno in Spanish “what happened, who’s fault was it?” Christ. I said “baby what’s wrong with you?” I don’t want to justify it.</p></li>

<p>Summer and Yan. Summer still hasn’t found a job, been a year or so. She was offered a job last week but turned it down because it would’ve been significantly lower level than what she had previously been employed at.

<p><strong>Lunch with Franz.</strong> - Working on a small LM model of patents. Goal is to build something specifically for patent lawyers, that would be very good on patents, and that would be a self-contained product, not a chatbot. Somehow it would collaborate with you in writing a patent. - Talking about translation: he says it’s a $20B industry, meaning human translators. But Google hardly earns any money. He says they set some very low cost on the API. - Talking about why Google search doesn’t have competition: the fact that they learn from their users. - Talked about counter-metrics for chatbots. If you optimize for user preference then, at some point, you should lose accuracy, as it’s just catering to the user’s tastes (the recognition-recall gap, or generator-discriminator gap.) - His wife worked at Google, she just retired.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<p><strong>It’s surprising that ML agents aren’t working better.</strong></p>
<pre><code>  Talking to Rob: I would expect that piling together multiple LLMs would be able to do a decent job at most takes. E.g. through (1) averaging multiple responses; (2) step-by-step reasoning; (3) critiquing each other; (4) doing some exploration of the world.

  _Sufficiently many parrots might make a person._
  
  Maybe it's true that they do well, but the latency is too high.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Q: can LLMs grade questions better than they can answer questions?</strong> E.g. on paragen you’d expect them to always pick their own submission but I’m sure they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>Working on AI is unfortunately not bringing out the best in people / war footing.</strong></p>
<pre><code>  I thought maybe it would be like going to war, that people would put down all their bullshit &amp; concentrate on the task. It would focus the mind.

  But I'm a bit disappointed:

  - Jonathan McKay.
  - Mayank -- very quickly he started talking about how he's just doing what leadership wants, not what's best. But in fact (1) he only has a loose understanding of what leaderhsip wants; (2) he's a .
  - Antonia Woodford: they wanted to wait on an experiment until the gain in logged-in exceeded the loss in logged-out. But this is purely obeying a technical rule.
  - Molly Jackman -- we hired her &amp; she seems technically very weak &amp; driven by politics.
  - Economists talking about labor substitution.
  - Philosophers writing 200 page rambling monographs, slicing things.

  Would like to just say this. Say to Mayank: I don't think you're doing a good job, &amp; better to go find something else to work on. I think (1) model switching work is drifing; (2) made bad call about monthly limits; (3) made bad call about volume pricing.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Some fraying relationships.</strong></p>
<pre><code>  - Mayank standing next to my desk, talking to Robert about GPUs.
  - I smile at Antonia Woodford but don't talk to her -&gt; I should suggest a coffee.
  - I very rarely see Jonathan around. / I think Jonathan is very concentrated on managing up -- on pleasing people he reports to. I want to ask David what specifically Jonathan has done that's good.
  - Alison I think I still have a good relationship with.
  - Minal I find very hard to read, doesn't make eye contact.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Bruno’s birthday.</strong></p>
<pre><code>  I bought a $60 banana cake from Tartines. Poured him a Crown Royal. 

  As soon as he arrived he said "happy birthday" and "how did it go," jumping in to anticipate the things I would say to him, to get in first.

  &gt; "I don't care if we burn $50 billion a year, we're building #AGI and it's going to be worth it.</code></pre>
