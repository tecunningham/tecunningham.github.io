   **Trip up.** Driver Homayoon Abdullah, I was scraping dogshit off my shoes. Waiting around for someone who was late.

   Pamela, Zoe, Rahul, Sandhini, Richard Ngo (Kings college) 


Hi all. FYI Citlali told us that the girls were kissing each other on the cheek in the bathroom at their club meeting last Friday night. Citlali said it was part of a trust game because kissing is something you do with your family. She didn't seem very secretive about it, but we told her it's better not to kiss each other.



# 2024-05-20 |                      openai: first day on research

   I joined a call between Pamela and comms/public affairs people. They seemed a bit exasperated that Pamela's work was vague and disorganized and low priority. Makes me a little anxious that I'll be lowered

   **Other people thought the work's not very valuable:**

   - **Reah was skeptical about econ-impacts work.** He worked on human labelling with someone on Pamela's team, he says it was something to do with AI for Icelandic, it didn't really go anywhere, fizzled out.
   - **Thomas skeptical that there are any economic impacts of GPT5.** He says Strawberry isn't going to put anybody out of work. 


   **I should make some precise opinions.**


# 2024-05-18 |                      openai: moving to research

   I talked to David up in Napa about doing a rotation.

   David says: will the work on research be as impactful as the work you'd otherwise be doing on analytics.

   Policy Research Offsite:

   > "If OpenAI continues its pattern of releasing a GPT model every 12-18 months, we can expect GPT-5 in fall 2024, GPT-6 in early 2026, and GPT-7 by late 2027. Given org timelines that project AGI by 2027, we are potentially just 1-3 deployments away.

   > "To put it another way, if this is our penultimate offsite before AGI, what infrastructure do we need to put in place now to ensure that only final adjustments are left for the next final offsite?



# 2024-05-17 |                      openai offsite Napa

   **Expensive but drab.** Fancy hotel, winery, restaurant. Everything expensive but drab, perfunctory. The hotel was new but with an old wooden staircase. The winery was new, they talked about how it's LEED certified, how the dining table is a rescued church door from a hurricane, and the insulation is from blue jeans. / The staff everywhere with forced enthusiasm. The winery guide said she shouldn't really be telling us this, or saying she shouldn't really be giving us this wine, but will anyway.

   Eric R arranged a party bus to take us up.

   **Personality test.** three poles: 
      - Red: achieving things
      - Blue: people/compassion
      - Green: analysis
   
   My answers were equally balanced, I was in the center. But then everyone else has to assess your personality. On my back the answers clustered between Red and Green, one person put me deep blue.

**Groups were right.**

   - Group: EricR, EricK, myself, Yilin. It's true the 3 of us will have strong opinions and push for them. 

**Each person introducing themselves.**

   - _Eric R:_ from Seattle but he says his life started in Pomona.
   - _Eric K:_ Ohio. 18 months in Bhutan, after maths at Northwestern. 
   - _Rob:_ started dancing at Pomona. His mother a book curator in DC.
   - _David:_ grew up in Santa Cruz, says he was a stoner at Berkeley studying cognitive science. He travelled with his girlfriend, was thinking of starting a business importing peppercorns from India. Saw people in India using Facebook on their flip phones, joined FB. His father is 3rd generation Japanese-American. He had tried to find ancestors in Japan but unsuccessfully.
   - _Paul._ Ohio, Cincinatti. Moved home after college to help look after his sister's children. He's in many choirs because of his low voice.
   - _Yilin_ Her parents architects, sent her to US to study architecture, but she switched to computer science. Did a masters, went to a gaming company. 
   - _Michael_ - missionary in Japan then worked in Canada speaking Japanese. Some kind of engineering, worked for Canadian telcom, slowly got into data engineering.
   - _Alex_ -- stayed in Santa Barbara working for some kind of finance company.
   - _Victoria_ -- Michigan, MIT. Soccer referee in school, she says she was better at refereeing than at playing soccer. She says it was good preparation for working as data science, because also relatively few women referees.


**Discussion about the group.**

   _Victoria saying she's working too fast_ -- only able to do shallow analyses, not doing big picture or building growth accounting table. 
   
   _Whether we need better data._  Eric K saying we need better data for reporting ; I say actually we're not constrained on quality of data for reporting. We already know most of these things , but we need to put them together in a coherent framework. Rob says we didn't even know if 4 was profitable because we hadn't been counting the gpus, I said more important than that.

   **Neptune / user day / spring update.**

      Everything went somewhat better than expected.

   **Talk with Zoe Hitzig.**

      She said she's going to be working on aligning preferences. E.g. how to distribute fairly without ads. Perhaps pay people for their data.

      I said working in industry it's useful to have a theory of how leaders make decisions (Zuckerberg, Musk, Altman), the difference between their stated and actual goals.

      I said that we shouldn't be too dismissive of ads, that mass media has been running for a century and a half on advertising, it's got all sorts of pathologies but it's a way of funding non-excludable technologies.

      I said that paying people for their data can be a bit dangerous. In social media many times platforms have messed up the intrinsic motivation of their users -- if you pay people for their contributions then they'll contribute less.

      I said the company doesn't really have any plans at longer horizon than 3-6 months.

   **Ilia and superalignment people leaving.**

      Ilia Sutskever
      Jan Lieke
      Andrej Karpathy

      Americans left behind: Greg Brockman, Sam Altman.


   **Trip to Napa with the team.** I'm half-excited about it. It seems like there will be a lot of blah-blah & need to find a way of dealing with that.

# 2024-05-13 |                      sunday

**Lindsay for dinner.** She was preparing to go to Kampala to work for MSF, then got very sick: had stopped taking her immunity drugs so she could take the yellow fever vaccine, but then got terribly sick.  / She talked about her VA HIV clinic in Oakland: black veterans, poor adherence to medicine, high viral load, only 30% rate of keeping appointments. She made a spreadsheet of all the veterans in the area, went through calling them all, she says it's now 90% appointment-keeping rate, and most have low viral load.

**Mothers' day.** Bruno calls and says "happy mothers' day" to Lynn, Lynn immediately says "happy mothers day" back. Difficult to say "thank you." / Both Bruno and Lynn are like that. Yolanda and Ruby less so.

**Baby Reindeer.** TV show of Scottish young man in London. Cowardly self destructive behavior. Not cleaned up: wrong choice at every turn.

**Email to David Laibson.**

   Dear David,

   I'm just writing to send some appreciation.
   
   I was thinking of you yesterday & you were a great influence on me when I was at Harvard in 2009-2012.
   
   In particular I was impressed by your *earnestness* about thinking through practical problems, trying to find a position of clarity, and quantifying things. It gave me a great confidence that it's a good use of time to try to think these things through.

   BTW I'm now at OpenAI, if you're ever in San Francisco would be very happy to meet for a coffee.

   Tom.

- Openness is a principle of scientific and medical practice.
- Principles of openess.
- In the US it has become political, better as a medical issue.
- Things have changed because of Cass review. Official information act requests.
- Figure showing increase in puberty blockers.
- Explain Gonadotrophin hormones: agonists not antagonists, they flood the pituitary with the hormone, suppresses normal production.
- Baseline rate - presumed to be precocious puberty. Less than 6 assumed to be 3.
- First guidelines in 2011 for dysphoria, 10X increase from baseline.
- What is use for gender dysphoria - Netherland in 1990s, gender identity.
- Rationale: concerns about high rates of psychological morbidity among adults who cannot pass as the other sex. 
- Dutch protocol: papers published in 2011 and 2014, fairly positive on 55 children.
- From 2011 to 2014 it spread around the world. Will discuss partly 2018.
- In 2022 the prevalence of 100/100,000; NZ appears to be 10 times higher than UK. 
- Has increase in dysphoria, has it.
- 2012 and 2019 surveys, found about 1% trans or nonbinary.
- 2022: But "growing up in nz study", in 2022 8% of girls, 1.5% of boys said non-gender-conforming.
- Changes: (1) big move from boys to girls; (2) autism; (3) from advantaged to disadvantaged.
- 2018: Increase in prescribing -- 2018 gender-affirming guidelines. After that treatment doubled in 3 years.
- Shift in rationale: instead it's to relieve gender distress, bodily goals, and time to learn.
- Used to be a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, but now it's self-diagnosed.
- Used to be that mental health problems should be controlled.
- Two causes of growth
   1. Looser criteria
   2. More people presenting
   - *In fact it's the interaction*.
- Don't understand the rise in gender dysphoria -- Cass says it's not plausible that social acceptability could explain it.
   - Very little persistence.
   - Many detransitioners, who said that transition didn't help.
- Don't give them time to think. Could be that it was careful diagnosis. But puberty suppression could alter the trajectory.
- Puberty blockers not known to be effective or safe. 
- Cass: puberty blocking should -> Cass says ; For trans women there's no point in giving them.
- Cass recommendation: only M->F, and only in research setting.

**Completions:** I ought to manually label (1) is this answer satisfactory; (2) could the model answer this  in principle? --> do it for 100 cases and get a baseline case.

**My writings are falling stillborn from the press.**

**Relationship between police and people is like between husband and wife.** 

   1. In the US the police are hostile, brusque, suspicious, in NZ they're not.
   2. Two sides: the police and the people.
   3. Each side think they're just reacting to the other side's behavior. Each side thinks they're just protecting themselves.
   4. When you're a new police officer you learn this, both from observing other officers, and from observing the people.
   5. _Just peer effects isn't sufficient for multiple equilibria_

> “First ask questions”: puberty suppression for gender-related distress

> An editorial in the Dutch Medical Journal last year called for dialogue: primum rogare, first ask questions. The seminar is an opportunity to pose questions about the practice of “gender affirming health care” for children and young people with gender dysphoria or incongruence. Specifically, to examine prescription of hormones to suppress puberty (Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone agonists) in New Zealand since 2011, and to consider the rationale for their use.

> There are sharply divergent views on this practice and some believe even asking questions poses a risk of harm in this sensitive area. Yet medicine is a moral practice and the norms of openness in science must apply. I will examine the arguments put forward by advocates for use of puberty blocking hormones. I will also examine the arguments of those who advise caution, informed by the just released Cass Review into gender identity services for children and young people in England. In discussing these matters I will consider the Medical Council Standards in relation to: prescribing a medicine for an unapproved indication, assessing the patient’s condition before prescribing, practicing in the patient’s best interests, assessing capacity to give consent, and providing balanced information. I will also consider a child’s right to an open future.


# 2024-05-10 |                      friday

   **Working from the garage today.** Actually it's a real joy to be here at the desk pounding some things out: comfortable chair.

   **Hannah Li talk at BATES.** Disappointing talk, it was just an experiment on MTurk showing that people did things that it was in their interests to do. About how people interact with algorithms strategically -- they choose to engage with things with a belief about how it'll influence the future algorithm's response.

   **Dinner at a Greek restaurant.** Rose, Nico, Guido, Hannah. Retsina, octopus, feta. Guido always seems a little uninterested and a little impatient yet he still keeps coming to these dinners. Nico.

   **Nico about applied science at Meta.** He says they had a very rough year after the layoffs. Everyone unhappy and it made them very conservative about their work. They were all very anxious about their jobs, and so they would only do very conservative projects. They would only do projects that they could get credit for, so they wouldn't lose their jobs. He said that the front end teams would not want to share credit with the back end teams, so they would not want to work with them.

   **Took a lift from Nico.** He has a huge engaging smile, he's also generous and clumsy.

   **Guido at Amazon.** He says he meets with many teams who bring their problems to him, it's like office hours. Most of the time it's about designing experiments that get at some variable, or non-experimental inference.

   **Hannah Li.** She's just started teaching operations & management at columbia, or just about to start teaching. Nico used to be in the same department. 

   **Hannah Li hesitation about optimization:** she's reading a book about how optimization has harmed the world, how it's made it more brittle somehow. She described examples but seemed a bit unclear whether they really were wrong in context. Something about optimizing crop yields and GM food, had made crops more fragile I think.

   **I talked about premature optimization.**

   **Johannes Ferstad.**



# 2024-05-08 |                      wednesday

   **Japantown.** We took Citlali to a ramen place, to Japanese bookshop, then to a little Japanese market where they sell things.

      It is nice to sit around the house and talk. Sitting around the house talking with mum and dad, playing word games, discussing things, puts extra folds in my brain.

# 2024-05-06 |                      

   **Cinco de Mayo in San Jose.** We drove down to Mexican cultural center in San Jose. 

   Oaxaca food truck: atole memelitas Oaxacan empanadas huarache.

   In the morning Citlali hit her head while she was bouncing around on the bed downstairs. Lynn and Yolanda fussing over her, she was crying and called out "I want papi." I lay down on the bed and snuggled with her, she calmed down & said that she was frustrated because Lynn and Yolanda kept asking her about it & she didn't want to talk about it. I said OK & we started talking about other things. Lynn and Yolanda kept passing by and asking Citlali about her head -- unnecessary things, asking her how did it happen, or why was she so sensitive about it -- & making her cry once again.

   Two things on Sunday:

   1. Getting back in the car Lynn said I shouldn't drive, because I had scratched the hub when I parked. I hadn't scratched the hub, I'd hit the curb with the tyre, it was some fantasy somehow Bruno had imagined it & then Lynn got the idea. I said OK who should drive then, obviously a bit irritated. Lynn got confused. I drived.
   
   2. On the drive home another car almost hit me. Lynn said to Bruno in Spanish "what happened, who's fault was it?" Christ. I said "baby what's wrong with you?" I don't want to justify it.


# 2024-05-05 |                      sunday

   **De Young / De Youngsters Day Out.** I spent a couple of hours writing at OpenAI in the morning, joy. Came home and we all went to the De Young.
   
   Later Lynn got very frustrated with Bruno, his bad driving. Won't admit when he makes a mistake. Came home in a bad mood, started giving orders to me, I ignore her and avoid her.

   Summer and Yan. Summer still hasn't found a job, been a year or so. She was offered a job last week but turned it down because it would've been significantly lower level than what she had previously been employed at. I told summer that I wanted a better sense of middle school and high school. 

   **Canelo fight.** Bruno standing up by the screen, taking photos. Citlali sat on the couch, drifting in and out of sleep. Canelo won.

# 2024-05-04 |                      saturday

   **Date in japantown.** Citlali went to have dinner with Aviv and Maggie. We later got a message from Tamar saying that she'd told them about rose and thorn, about how her cousin (Ruby) had got an ear piercing. Went with Bruno and Yolanda to Pacifica, walking up and down the beach. Bruno hurt his leg from walking down a scree face instead of down the path. Lynn and I went to Japantown to get ramen. Funny to be .

   **Lunch with Franz.**
      - Working on a small LM model of patents. Goal is to build something specifically for patent lawyers, that would be very good on patents, and that would be a self-contained product, not a chatbot. Somehow it would collaborate with you in writing a patent.
      - Talking about translation: he says it's a $20B industry, meaning human translators. But Google hardly earns any money. He says they set some very low cost on the API.
      - Talking about why Google search doesn't have competition: the fact that they learn from their users. 
      - Talked about counter-metrics for chatbots. If you optimize for user preference then, at some point, you should lose accuracy, as it's just catering to the user's tastes (the recognition-recall gap, or generator-discriminator gap.)
      - His wife worked at Google, she just retired.

   **Dinner with Yilei.**

      - We went to a little wine bar. A tin of sardines with bread, very nice.
      - He says for 8 months at Twitter he would only work 4 hours a day. Elon didn't want to fire him for some reason. So he worked on open-sourcing some of his old code, and he got some of his more junior people promoted.

# 2024-05-04 |                      notes

Two things today:

   1. Matrix -> use Chris' notebook
   2. Manifesto on tweaking response type.

Smaller:

   1. Nulligen paragen results
   2. Nulligen response rates (left join)
   3. Table with *all* augmented paragen results, with CIs, and skip rates.
   4. Placebo augmented paragens

Specifics:

   1. ~~That this would bring out the best in people.~~
   2. ~~Difficult relationships with people~~
   3. On superhuman persuasion -- ceiling-on-ai-performance-persuasion
   4. ~~Surprising that agents don't work that well.~~
   5. Placeholder in predictions: could have a qualitatively different type of interface.
   6. Add preface to "predictions" that these are personal.
   7. Read note on post-training.
   8.  Print out the paper on personal identity.
   9.  Simple principles for pricing & limits

Notes:

   **It's surprising that ML agents aren't working better.**

      Talking to Rob: I would expect that piling together multiple LLMs would be able to do a decent job at most takes. E.g. through (1) averaging multiple responses; (2) step-by-step reasoning; (3) critiquing each other; (4) doing some exploration of the world.

      _Sufficiently many parrots might make a person._
      
      Maybe it's true that they do well, but the latency is too high.

   **Q: can LLMs grade questions better than they can answer questions?** E.g. on paragen you'd expect them to always pick their own submission but I'm sure they don't.

   **Working on AI is unfortunately not bringing out the best in people / war footing.**

      I thought maybe it would be like going to war, that people would put down all their bullshit & concentrate on the task. It would focus the mind.

      But I'm a bit disappointed:

      - Jonathan McKay.
      - Mayank -- very quickly he started talking about how he's just doing what leadership wants, not what's best. But in fact (1) he only has a loose understanding of what leaderhsip wants; (2) he's a .
      - Antonia Woodford: they wanted to wait on an experiment until the gain in logged-in exceeded the loss in logged-out. But this is purely obeying a technical rule.
      - Molly Jackman -- we hired her & she seems technically very weak & driven by politics.
      - Economists talking about labor substitution.
      - Philosophers writing 200 page rambling monographs, slicing things.

      Would like to just say this. Say to Mayank: I don't think you're doing a good job, & better to go find something else to work on. I think (1) model switching work is drifing; (2) made bad call about monthly limits; (3) made bad call about volume pricing.

   **Some fraying relationships.**

      - Mayank standing next to my desk, talking to Robert about GPUs.
      - I smile at Antonia Woodford but don't talk to her -> I should suggest a coffee.
      - I very rarely see Jonathan around. / I think Jonathan is very concentrated on managing up -- on pleasing people he reports to. I want to ask David what specifically Jonathan has done that's good.
      - Alison I think I still have a good relationship with.
      - Minal I find very hard to read, doesn't make eye contact.

   **Bruno's birthday.**

      I bought a $60 banana cake from Tartines. Poured him a Crown Royal. 

      As soon as he arrived he said "happy birthday" and "how did it go," jumping in to anticipate the things I would say to him, to get in first.

**Things to explain.**

   _why DALL-e pictures look slimy_

   _why Nabokov prose reads slimy_

   __


**Aesthetics in general.**

   _Low-dimensional representation_ -- implicit knowledge, can recognize, takes a lot of work to be able to produce things.

   _Satisfying multiple criteria_ -- peaks in the lanscape where multiple things all satisfied; picture, poem, joke.

   _What you're used to_ -- customary.

   _Characteristic mistakes_ -- cliches, sloppy plot ; errors of hubris.

**AI.**

   _Computers finally learned the low-dimensional representation_
         
         - Could do other things easy.

   _They predict what is frequent, not what is good_
