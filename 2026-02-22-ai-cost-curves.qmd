Observatinons:

1. Generally, agents are cheaper but less capable.
2. Can simplify to say agents are free, without much loss.
3. We can see three types of growth: (A) cheaper inference; (B) ; 
4. This theory maps exactly to time horizon. 
5. Can derive these curves from a theory (???).



It's super useful to draw plots showing achievement vs expenditure for humans vs computers, like this:

```{tikz}
\input{2026-02-22-ai-cost-curves-tikz-helpers.tex}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
  \AICostAxes
  \AICostGaussianCDF{0.7}{0.2}{0.90}{black!60}{human}{1pt}
  \AICostGaussianCDF{0.5}{0.2}{0.50}{red!60}{agent}{-2pt}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

You can read the y-axis in a few ways: (1) score on a benchmark; (2) quality of the output; (3) score on some optimization problem.

Some observations:

1. Today, for a given levcomputers are either cheaper than humans or .


```{tikz}
\input{2026-02-22-ai-cost-curves-tikz-helpers.tex}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
  \AICostAxes
  \AICostGaussianCDF{0.6}{0.15}{0.95}{teal!70!black}{fast-adopting}{2pt}
  \AICostGaussianCDF{1.4}{0.42}{0.60}{purple!70!black}{slow-adopting}{-4pt}
\end{tikzpicture}
```
