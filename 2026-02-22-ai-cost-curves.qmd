It's useful to draw plots showing achievement vs expenditure, comparing humans & agents.

You can read the y-axis in a few ways: (1) score on a benchmark; (2) quality of the output; (3) score on an optimization problem.

Observations:

1. In most cases agents are cheaper than humans but hit a ceiling in capability.
2. Can simplify to say agents are free, without much loss.
3. We can see three types of agent growth: (A) cheaper inference; (B) expanded capabilities; (C) test-time growth. 
4. Distillation shifts cost curves left.
5. This observation is a nice fit for time horizon (more discussion required)
6. Q: can you derive these curves from a theory of task complexity?

Basic plot:


```{tikz}
\input{2026-02-22-ai-cost-curves-tikz-helpers.tex}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
  \AICostAxes
  \AICostGaussianCDF{0.7}{0.2}{0.90}{black!60}{human}{1pt}
  \AICostGaussianCDF{0.5}{0.2}{0.50}{red!60}{agent}{-2pt}
\end{tikzpicture}
```


Three types of agent change:

```{tikz}
\input{2026-02-22-ai-cost-curves-tikz-helpers.tex}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=4]
  \AICostAxes
  %\AICostGaussianCDF{0.7}{0.2}{0.90}{black!60}{human}{1pt}
  \AICostGaussianCDF{0.5}{0.2}{0.50}{red!60,dashed}{}{-2pt}
  \AICostGaussianCDF{0.3}{0.2}{0.50}{red!60}{}{-2pt}
  \AICostGaussianCDF{0.5}{0.2}{0.70}{red!60}{}{-2pt}
  \AICostGaussianCDF{0.6}{0.3}{0.70}{red!60}{}{-2pt}
  \node[red!60] at (0.6,0.83) {\footnotesize (more capable)};
  \draw[->,red!60] (0.6,0.8) -- (.7,0.6);
  \node[red!60] at (1.5,0.55) {\footnotesize (more returns to inference)};
  \draw[->,red!60] (1.05,0.55) -- (0.9,0.55);
  \node[red!60] at (0.2,0.53) {\footnotesize (cheaper)};
  \draw[->,red!60] (0.2,0.5) -- (0.3,0.3);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Extra plots:


```{tikz}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
  \AICostAxes
  \AICostGaussianCDF{0.6}{0.15}{0.95}{teal!70!black}{fast-adopting}{2pt}
  \AICostGaussianCDF{1.4}{0.42}{0.60}{purple!70!black}{slow-adopting}{-4pt}
