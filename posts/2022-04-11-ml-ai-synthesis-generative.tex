\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Arificial neural nets (ANNs) work by finding latent
  hierarchical structures in data.} If you feed them images they will
  learn to represent both low-level features (brightness, contrast,
  texture, line direction) and more abstract features (objects, light
  direction, style). If you feed them text they will learn to represent
  both low-level features (vocabulary, sentences, paragraphs, chapters)
  and more abstract features (tone, syntactical rules, logical
  structure).

  It is difficult to know how much of the performance of neural nets
  reflects them learning deep abstract representation vs just doing
  shallow permutations of the training data, in part because the
  training sets and the parameter spaces are both so large (about a
  trillion of each). Without knowing the depth of representation we can
  still observe that the outputs are useful for a broad range of
  practical tasks.
\item
  \textbf{It seems plausible that neural nets will find latent
  structures that humans haven't discovered yet.} They are good at
  discovering hidden structure: they might find a visual way of
  discriminating between male and female chicks (something that humans
  cannot do), they might find a new assocation between diet and cancer.
\item
  \textbf{Generative models produce what is \emph{probable} not what is
  \emph{good}.} Many generative models (both text and image) can be
  thought of as generating data that is \emph{likely} conditional on a
  prompt. Thus they will produce an output that has good qualities
  (logical, harmonious, perspicacious) just to the degree that the
  training data has those good qualities, but not because they are
  trying to achieve those good qualities. The typical training data does
  have good qualities compared to random data.

  If flaws in the training dataset are random (orthogonal to each other)
  then generative models can do better than the average human. If flaws
  in the training set are consistently in the same direction then
  generated content will reproduce the same flaws.

  The situation is more complicated for models that have been fine-tuned
  with human feedback, e.g.~chatGPT which has been which is trained with
  an additional layer of explicit rating for quality (RLHF).
\item
  \textbf{Unlike humans, computers can use their representations to
  synthesize new artefacts.} Human judgment has a notable asymmetry: we
  can easily recognize when an object satisfies a given property, but
  it's much harder to synthesize a new object that satisfies that
  property. E.g. we can trivially tell whether a joke is funny, or a
  poem rhymes, or a picture looks realistic, but we find it difficult to
  create a funny joke, a rhyming poem, or a realistic picture. This is
  sometimes attributed to the hierarchical and feed-foward nature of how
  the brain processes information.

  Artificial neural nets do not suffer from the same degree of
  asymmetry. They can be reversed to synthesize new objects that satisfy
  a given property. This means computers will be able to do
  qualitatively different things that humans cannot do, even with the
  same amount of knowledge.
\item
  \textbf{The economics: it seems plausible that OpenAI would become the
  dominant firm.} The costs in AI are mostly fixed costs and so we might
  expect an equilibrium with a single dominant firm whose pricing power
  is limited by the threat of entry from other firms.\sidenote{\footnotesize John
    Sutton's model of ``endogenous sunk costs'' seems a good fit: as the
    market gets larger the sunk costs increase, and so concentration
    does not fall.} I think there is an analogy to the economics of web
  search where Google is the dominant firm, but is threatened by other
  potential entrants, and for that reason can only capture a small share
  of the total surplus generated. In most industries the first-mover
  retains their position for a long time so it seems plausible that
  OpenAI will become the dominant firm in AI. There also seem to be
  substantial economies of scope across use-cases, thus it doesn't seem
  likely that there would be different firms specialized for different
  use-cases (the same is true for search: it has not fractured into
  different markets).
\item
  \textbf{The effect on entertainment: platforms produce their own
  synthetic content.} It seems likely that computers could synthesize
  adequate-quality entertainment: stories, porn, music, television,
  video clips, computer games. The typical adult spends perhaps 5
  hours/day on passive entertainment and much of it is fairly generic,
  meaning it could be generated by a computer and it would be similarly
  entertaining, and the audience wouldn't be upset. The firms likely to
  synthesize the best content would be those with access to large
  datasets on both content and engagement, e.g.~Facebook, YouTube,
  TikTok, Netflix. Some platforms which are two-sided might become
  mostly one-sided because once they synthesize their own content they
  no longer need to attract creators. Platforms which host communication
  between real-life friends (e.g.~FB, IG, WA) would retain a competitive
  edge because that content cannot be so easily displaced by synthetic
  content.

  In the short-run we could expect computers to produce content that is
  similar to existing content, but in the medium-term they might learn
  what features make it maximally engaging, in a similar way to how
  headline-writers have learned how to maximize peoples' propensity to
  click. As a consequence it's hard to anticipate how entertainment
  might evolve.

  Peoples' tastes depend heavily on their experience: people like what
  they're familiar with. As a consequence we might expect that in the
  short-run synthetic content will resemble what people already consume,
  but in the long-run it could get very weird (just through the
  evolution of tastes, setting aside any technological advances).
\item
  \textbf{The effect on art: computers could make art that is better
  than humans can.} I think there's a compelling argument that computers
  will be able to make art that is \emph{better} than humans can in
  certain ways. The success of an artwork is often judged by its ability
  to satisfy multiple different criteria simultaneously. For example a
  good picture both (a) depicts a specific scene, and (b) is a
  harmonious arrangement of colours. A good poem both (a) tells a story,
  (b) rhymes, and (c) scans. A good piece of music has symmetry at many
  levels. It's easy for humans to recognize when an existing artwork
  successfully satisfies multiple criteria but hard to create a new
  artwork that satisfies those criteria. Neural nets allow computers to
  learn to represent the characteristics of artworks, and so it seems
  plausible they would become better than humans in being able to find
  permutations that satisfy them.\sidenote{\footnotesize Computers have been better
    than humans at solving well-specified combinatorial problems for 70
    years. The difference with newer generations of algorithms is that
    they can now perceive categories that humans learn unconsciously:
    harmony, rhythm, representation, semantics, etc.}
\item
  \textbf{The effect on programming: increased efficiency.} GPTs are
  already being used a lot by programmers, I think their primary uses
  are (1) saving time looking up knowledge, e.g.~the names of function
  calls; (2) filling in boilerplate details.
\end{enumerate}

It seems paradoxical that a short prompt can be reliably translated into
a long piece of code because it implies that the generated code contains
redundant information. Why would programming languages have so much
redundancy? However there is an asymmetry between writing and reading
code: it makes sense to write code with the details implicit (it saves
time) but read code with the details explicit (it helps with debugging
and confirming the logic).\sidenote{\footnotesize Relatedly Djikstra argued that
  advances in mathematics were accompanied by formalizations of the
  notation
  (\href{https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html}{On
  the foolishness of ``natural language programming''}, )}

It seems likely that NN-augmented code would have a bigger relative
effect on the productivity of high-skilled programmers than on
low-skilled programmers (AKA skill-biased technical change).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{8}
\item
  \textbf{The effect on adversarial problems: help the bad guys more
  than the good guys.} In adversarial situations like spam-detection
  computers will help both spammers and spam-detectors, but they seem
  likely to shift the balance in favor of the spammers because of the
  relative advantage computers have at synthesizing over recognizing
  content (compared to humans). Humans can intuitively discriminate
  between real and fake artefacts, but that ability will become less
  valuable when computers have learned the cues that humans use to make
  those discriminations.
\item
  \textbf{The effect on communication systems: greater reliance on
  \emph{provenance} than on \emph{content}.} When evaluating a message
  we can use signals either from the content or the provenance
  (i.e.~where the message come from). Many communication systems already
  rely heavily on provenance, e.g.~spam detection is mostly based on the
  sender, not what is sent. However as generative ML improves we should
  expect equilibrium to move even further in the direction of provenance
  and reputation and away from content.
\item
  \textbf{The effect on employment.} LLMs are able to produce outputs
  that are near-indistinguishable from humans in many domains, so it
  seems likely it would displace humans.

  However previous computer technologies had much smaller effects on
  output and employment than were initially predicted: (1) in the 1950s
  many people thought optimization algorithms (e.g.~linear programming)
  would greatly increase productivity but I think the effect was small;
  (2) in the 1970s many people thought that experts would be replaced by
  simple algorithms (e.g.~linear regression), but I think the effect was
  small; (3) in the 1990s many people thought computers and the internet
  would greatly boost productivity, but I think the effect was small.

\textbf{Media.}

\textbf{Illustration: mostly synthetic.} Generative models can already
create illustrations to the quality of an above-average advertisement or
children's book. So it seems like that 100s of thousands of people who
are working in illustration will find themselves replaced by algorithms.
I would guess that demand for illustration is pretty inelastic, so
increases in productivity decrease employment. 100 years ago mechanical
reproduction of artworks decreased employment of musicians, painters,
carvers, etc.

Precedents:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\Alph{enumi})}
\item
  the ability to reproduce artworks (printing press, colour
  reproductions, stamped decorations, recorded music) led to a
  substantial loss of employment.
\item
  electronic synthesis of musical instruments probably led to
  unemployment of musicians.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Entertainment: mostly synthetic.} People spend perhaps 10\% of
their waking life watching entertainment: TV sitcoms and soaps, funny
videos on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. It seems likely that 50\% of
this could be replaced by entirely synthetic content in 3 years. In the
short run I guess ML will produce content that's indistinguishable from
regular content but after a while it could get very weird.

\textbf{Ads: mostly synthetic.} These models could be used to create
brand new ads designed to maximize propensity to click on them, or to
buy the product. I think these could be quite powerful because (1)
Facebook and Google already have databases with hundreds of millions of
ads and trillions of interactions to learn from; (2) ML could experiment
very efficiently to figure out what maximizes conversion rates.

In the past few years advertisers have been learning what makes people
click: ``1 simple trick for belly fat'', ``see this pimple pop'', ``see
child stars now.'' Advertisers have always been doing they volume and
granularity allows them to do it quicker. I expect ML accelerate it
again, helping identify the sensitive parts of our brains which make us
curious.

\textbf{Spam: no dramatic change.} We can define ``spam'' as advertising
trying to disguise itself as organic content.

Over the last few decades spam has increased as the price of
communication has fallen (SMS, email, social media).

Platforms have been able to keep it under control by looking for
patterns in the \emph{quantity} of messages: (a) detecting the same
message being sent a million times; or (b) detecting that a million
messages are all coming from a common source. New ML models will make it
harder to distinguish based on content because it's cheap to make
variations, though it will remain difficult to counterfeit the source.

\textbf{Informational content: not sure.} News, informative articles \&
videos, product reviews, celebrity gossip, discussion boards.

\textbf{Taste: shift towards aesthetic minimalism.} The ability to
cheaply generate new artworks seems likely to change tastes. I believe
something similar happened in the late 19th and early 20th century. In
the 19th century it became much cheaper to add ornamentat onto objects,
e.g.~printed patterns on clothes, machine-woven fabric, stamped tinwork,
moulded plaster. In the early 20th century ornamentation gradually fell
out of fashion and there followed a general taste for simple minimalist
objects which has mostly survived until today.

\hypertarget{historical-trends-in-the-economics-of-creation}{%
\subsection{Historical Trends in the Economics of
Creation}\label{historical-trends-in-the-economics-of-creation}}

I think it's useful to compare the introduction of synthetic
composition, AKA generative ML, to three prior technological changes
which affected creation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The introduction of synthetic materials.
\item
  The mechanical reproduction of artworks.
\item
  Photography.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{(1) The introduction of synthetic materials.} Early humans would
make everything from wood, stone, and animal skins. We then gradually
learned how to use metal, glass, oil, plastic, etc., and we can now
create almost any combination of shape, colour, texture, taste, smell.

Despite the freedom we have, many everyday products are still faux-wood,
faux-stone, and faux-animal skin. We seem to have cultural preferences
that are shaped by historical circumstances and which last many
generations. Put another way: consumption choices at a given point in
time seem highly influenced by budget constraints from prior points in
time.

\textbf{(2) The invention of mechanical reproduction.} We have gradually
invented many means of reproducing individual activities:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  5000BC: cast metal into molds
\item
  3000BC: writing (reproduction of speech)
\item
  600BC: printing
\item
  1000s: printing with movable type
\item
  1800s: colour printing
\item
  1840s: photography
\item
  1890s: recorded sound and music
\item
  1900s: moving pictures
\item
  1930s: colour film
\item
  2020s: virtual reality
\end{itemize}

The equilibrium impact of mechanical reproduction depends on the
preference for variety.\sidenote{\footnotesize Suppose that goods come in various
  different varieties and you can consume a certain quantity of each
  variety. We can say that before mechanical reproduction you would
  produce exactly one unit of each variety, and after mechanical
  reproduction you could produce multiple units of an existing variety
  at a cost lower than producing a new variety.} If people have a strong
taste for variety, meaning people strongly prefer an idiosyncratic
object over an object that is identical to others, then mechanical
reproduction would have little impact. Taste for variety could come
either from a strict preference people have for differentiation
(different from what they're familiar with or different from their
neighbours), or from each person having idiosyncratic needs (the degree
to which tailored clothing is more comfortable than off-the-rack).

Overall I think the preference for variety has not been sufficiently
strong to prevent mass production from dramatically reshaping production
and consumption.

It used to be that every family or village would have its own musician,
story-teller, tailor, painter, cook, carpenter, blacksmith. Now most of
the creative work is done by few guys in New York or LA and packaged up
for the rest of us. They compose a song, a story, draw a picture, design
a jacket or a piece of furniture, or come up with a recipe, which is
then reproduced and shipped to every house in the world. There are a few
professions remaining where people do one-off creative work:
hairdressers, chefs, tattoo artists.

Although demand for artisans has substantially shrunk there are still
perhaps surprisingly many. Most cities still have professional
orchestras and opera companies, there are still many professional
artists.

\textbf{(3) Photography.} Since photography was invented drawing and
painting have become much less focussed on realism. Instead popular
drawing and painting tends to be stylized in one way or another.

\hypertarget{observations-on-taste}{%
\subsection{Observations on Taste}\label{observations-on-taste}}

\textbf{We live in a corner of the room} We value things that are
familiar.

\textbf{Lowering cost will lower value.} Walter Benjamin: mass
production caused the individual work to have less value. Similarly we
should expect synthesis to render the \emph{type} of work less valuable,
not just the individual work.

\textbf{People like things that are superficially real.} We watch a lot
of reality shows, true-crime, documentaries. They are constrained to be
factual, but people don't really care if they're actually true.
Professional wrestling, celebrity drama (Kardashians). All in a world of
pretend-reality.

\textbf{People still go to concerts, despite record players.}

\textbf{People still want new music, despite old music existing.}

\textbf{Scarcity makes a thing more valuable.} Gold, diamonds, pearls,
purple robes.

\textbf{Difficulty makes a thing more valuable.} Elaborate embroidery,
elaborate carving. Ornament was valuable for thousands of years. Fell
out of favor and minimalism became ascendant as ornament became cheap.
(upward-sloping demand, Veblen good.)

\textbf{New technologies imitate the constraints of prior technologies.}
Synthetic glass, rubber, margarine, music.

\hypertarget{how-neural-nets-work}{%
\section{How Neural Nets Work}\label{how-neural-nets-work}}

\textbf{Neural nets decompose a set of inputs into a hierarchy of latent
components.} E.g. when given a set of images neural nets will discover
they are best organized by object and pose and lighting. When given a
set of text inputs they will be organized into language and syntax and a
set of semantic features. Early neural nets would output a single scalar
prediction but once a net has learned a latent representation we can
also reverse the process and find inputs that match the output,
e.g.~generating images to go with text, etc..

\textbf{Neural nets work because the world is hierarchical.}

They don't work as well when the data does not have a latent
hierarchical structure, e.g.~neural nets aren't particularly impressive
with tabular or time-series data.

They don't work as well when we have a small dataset: with a small
dataset a ``structural'' model will tend to do better, i.e.~effectively
hard-coding the priors into the model, because with a small dataset
there's less ability to discover the latent hierarchical structure.

\hypertarget{how-artificial-neural-nets-work}{%
\subsection{How Artificial Neural Nets
Work}\label{how-artificial-neural-nets-work}}

A very simplified description:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{A model is a mapping from an input to an output.} An input is
  typically some high-dimensional data, e.g.~text, photo, video, a
  sequence of DNA. The prototypical output is a low-dimensional
  prediction: e.g.~predict what object is depicted in the photo, or what
  word comes next.

  However the models can also be adapted to output high-dimensional
  predictions, e.g.~as in synthesizing pictures based off captions, or
  segmenting a photo into parts.
\item
  \textbf{A model consists of a pyramid of layers.} Each layer is a set
  of nodes. In the simplest case the bottom layer has one node for each
  element of raw input and the top layer has a single node which
  represents the prediction, and each layer is connected only to the
  layer below it. The state of the model can be represented by weights
  in the connections between each layer. Progressively higher layers are
  generally thought to represent progressively more abstract features of
  the data.\sidenote{\footnotesize \includegraphics{images/2023-03-25-07-46-44.png}
    (Rough sketch of GPT-3 architecture but it needs to be redrawn: the
    numbers are wrong, and I think the wiring of the inputs is a bit
    wrong too.)}
\item
  \textbf{A model is trained by successive approximation.} The model
  weights are initialized at random then updated by iterating through a
  very large set of training data, often billions of items. After each
  trial the prediction error is calculated (the difference between
  prediction and outcome) and then weights are updated in the direction
  of the error (``gradient descent'').
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{why-artificial-neural-nets-work}{%
\subsection{Why Artificial Neural Nets
Work}\label{why-artificial-neural-nets-work}}

\textbf{Neural nets discover latent structure in the input.} The
standard story about neural nets is that they learn to factor the input
into its most important underlying components.

Here are some intuitive ways in which data can be described as a
combination of separate components.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.2593}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.7407}}@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
\begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}\raggedright
observable (\(\bm{x}\))
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}\raggedright
latent (\(\bm{v}\))
\end{minipage} \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
photo of object & object depicted, orientation, lighting, exposure,
background \\
photo of digit & digit, size, orientation, width, aspect ratio, line
width \\
sequence of words & language, dialect, subject, object, verb \\
\end{longtable}

Formally we can think of latent factors as having informational power
over observables, e.g.~if we have a probability distribution over
observables we can factor it as:

\[P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\sum_{v\in V}\utt{P(x_1|v)\ldots P(x_n|v)P(v)}{inputs conditionally}{independent given $v$}\]

Where \(v\) is a latent factor (or set of latent factors). This gives a
more parsimonious representation of the structure of input, and allows
us to easily generate conditional expectations, e.g.~\(E[x_i|x_j]\). The
latent factors could be continuous, e.g.~extracting principal
components, or they could be discrete, e.g.~words, phrases, tropes,
dialects, types of animals.

Consider a very stylized task: an image of a random digit (0-9) with a
random size and orientation. Given those three variables then every
pixel is deterministic:

\[P(\ut{x_1,\ldots,x_n}{pixels})=( \prod_i \ut{P(x_i|\text{digit},\text{size},\text{orientation})}{$\in\{0,1\},$, i.e. deterministic}) P(\text{digit})P(\text{size})P(\text{orientation})\]

So we can reduce this high-dimensional set of pixels into just three
latent factors.

\textbf{The components are often organized hierarchically.} This
simplest way of finding latent structure is to look for linear
combinations of features that are the most predictive (principal
components analysis). However neural nets greatly outperform these
algorithms because of their hierarchical organization: the lower layers
extract superficial features, the higher layers extract deeper features.
The same hierarchical structure appears in the visual cortex: neurons in
early areas seem to represent local or superficial features of the scene
(colours, shadows, lighting), while later areas represent more abstract
features (specific people seen, etc.).

LeCun gave a
\href{http://matt.colorado.edu/compcogworkshop/talks/lecun.pdf}{talk}
circa 2015 where he says \emph{``Deep Learning addresses the problem of
learning hierarchical representations with a single algorithm''}.

\textbf{Hierarchical neural nets work because the world is
hierarchical.} The fact that hierarchical ANNs work, and that our brains
have a hierarchical, implies that the processes in the world which
generate the input data are themselves highly hierarchical.

Property of hierarchical structure: \emph{context-dependence}. When data
is hierarchical then any individual feature is not very predictive of
another feature, it all dependds on the context. E.g. the relationship
between the color of an individual pixel and a word used in the label,
or relationship between occurrence of one word in the input and another
word.

\textbf{Neural nets have performed much more succesfully than two
alternative approaches:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Hand-coded models.} Models where the hierarchical structure is
  explicitly hand-coded by the programmer.
\item
  \emph{Non-hierarchical models.} E.g. linear regression, where the
  computer learns the weights on different features but doesn't
  construct new features from the existing ones.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraint Satisfaction}\label{constraint-satisfaction}}

\textbf{Setup: choosing a vector to satisfy a set of constraints.} We
have a sequence of parameters, \((x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) and there are some
conditions \(P^A(\bm{x}),\ldots,P^C(\bm{x})\in\{0,1\}\), and we want to
satisfy all of them. E.g. (1) we're choosing a sequence of words that
should satisfy constraints on syntax, rhyme, and meter; (2) we're
choosing a matrix of pixels such that the picture looks like a pig and
is symmetrical and in vaporwave style.

\textbf{Q: Can we derive an efficient order in which to choose
elements?} Given the condition \(P(\bm{x})\) can we say something about
the efficient order in which to choose elements, e.g.~it's less
expensive to choose \(x_i\) before \(x_j\), than to choose \(x_j\)
before \(x_i\)?

\textbf{Q: Could a model do better than the training data?} Suppose the
training data consists of \(\bm{x}\) produced by people trying to
satisfy the constraints. We think that neural nets are good at creating
new instances that satisfy the constraints, but is there a sense in
which a model trained on this data could do \emph{better} than the data
in the training set?

\hypertarget{examples}{%
\subsubsection{Examples}\label{examples}}

\textbf{Rhyming words.} You want to choose word 1 and word 2. Each word
has its own constraint, plus the two words have to rhyme. The rhyming
constraint can be represented as a block diagonal matrix (with suitable
reshuffling of rows and columns). Here I have drawn the constraints such
that there's only one solution (highlighted). You could also draw this
such that there's a clear optimal order: suppose that there's no
constraint on word 1, then it's best to choose word 2 first and word 1
second.

\includegraphics{2022-04-11-ml-ai-synthesis-generative_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf}

\textbf{Rhyming couplets.} Suppose you have to choose 6 words, from a
bank of 1000 one-syllable words, such that the words have this form:

\begin{verbatim}
  NOUN-VERB-NOUN
  NOUN-VERB-NOUN
\end{verbatim}

and the two lines must rhyme. If your training set is entirely couplets
that satisfy these criteria then you can factor the likelihood:

\[P(x_1,\ldots,x_6)=\ut{P_N(x_1)}{is noun}\ut{P_V(x_2)}{is verb}P_N(x_3)
      P_N(x_4)P_V(x_5)P_N(x_6)\ut{P_R(x_3,x_6)}{rhyme}.
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{It's inefficient to solve this problem forwards.} If you choose
  words sequentially, from \(x_1\) to \(x_6\), just satisfying
  constraints up to this point, then you may choose a noun at \(x_3\)
  which has no other rhymes. Then you've entered a dead end. So if
  you're searching for a solution to this problem (an \(\bm{x}\in W^6\)
  that satisfies the constraints) then it's most efficient to start by
  choosing two nouns that rhyme, and then you won't have to backtrack.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{It is surprising that autoregressive LLMs can write decent
rhyming poetry.} It seems like the logical structure would make it hard
to write from front to back. I guess they're able to perform OK just
because of the volume of training data. (AR-LLMs should avoid ever using
``orange'' at the end of a line, anticipating that it'll be hard to find
a rhyme for it.)

\hypertarget{efficient-order-for-solving}{%
\subsubsection{Efficient Order for
Solving}\label{efficient-order-for-solving}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{If a constraint is separable then the order doesn't matter.}
  If we can write a constraint as
  \[P(\bm{x})=P_1(x_1)\times\ldots\times P_n(x_n),\] then we can just
  decompose and find a solution to each of these problems separately.
\item
  \textbf{If given a set of constraints, efficient to satisfy the
  low-cardinality constraints first.} Suppose we are given a set of
  constraints, \(P^A,P^B,P^C\), and we want to satisfy all of them. It's
  efficient to first solve the constraints which are (1) unidimensional,
  and (2) low cardinality. E.g. suppose constraint A applies only to
  word 2, and it is only satisfied by a single word, then it's most
  efficient to choose word 2 first and choose word 1 next.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{venn-diagram-model-recognizing-vs-synthesizing}{%
\subsection{Venn Diagram Model (Recognizing vs
Synthesizing)}\label{venn-diagram-model-recognizing-vs-synthesizing}}

\textbf{Suppose we have some high-dimensional space,} e.g.~the space of
all possible tweets, books, images, sounds. In that space we can define
the subset of tweets that are funny, the set of images that look like a
cat, etc.

We can make two generalizations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Humans are generally good at learning to recognize membership
  in a set, but bad at synthesizing new examples.} We can easily
  recognize whether a joke is funny, a melody is pretty, or a drawing is
  of a cat. But it takes us much more work to create a funny joke, a
  pretty melody, or a recognizable drawing of a cat.
\item
  \textbf{Computers are good at both recognizing membership in a subset
  and synthesizing new examples of that subset.}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Why are humans bad at synthesis?} I think the basic reason is
that the information used in recognizing membership is
\emph{encapsulated}, i.e.~the information used to recognize objects is
stored in pre-conscious parts of our brain, and for that reason cannot
be used synthesize new instances. Some evidence related to this:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Impenetrability of perception.} In psychology it's a common
  point of view that perception is ``cognitively impenetrable'' or
  ``informationally encapsulated'', meaning that it makes inferences
  using only a subset of the information available. Pylyshyn (1999)
  says:\sidenote{\footnotesize Proponents of encapsulated perception: Helmholtz
    (1866), Pylyshyn (1980), Fodor (1983). I think there's a debate
    about the degree to which some top-down influences can affect
    perception but most people agree that there's substantial
    encapsulation, see Pylyshyn (1999).}

  \begin{quote}
  ``a major portion of vision \ldots{} does its job without the
  intervention of knowledge, beliefs or expectations, even when using
  that knowledge would prevent it from making errors.''
  \end{quote}
\item
  \emph{Moravec's paradox.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Moravec: ``it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult
    level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and
    difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old
    when it comes to perception and mobility.''
  \item
    Pinker: ``The main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is
    that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard.''
  \item
    Minsky: ``In general, we're least aware of what our minds do best,''
    he writes, and adds ``we're more aware of simple processes that
    don't work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly.''
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{There are some cases where computers are bad at synthesis.} A
computer can easily recognize whether a string satisfies a cryptographic
property, e.g.~if its md5 hash is the same as that of some other string,
but it's much much harder to synthesize a string which satisfies this
property. This is a case where the informational content is low but the
computational cost is high.

\hypertarget{communication-synthesis}{%
\subsection{Communication \& Synthesis}\label{communication-synthesis}}

\textbf{Communication systems rely on good-faith actors.} A common
pattern is a communication system starts with a group of people who act
in good-faith but is then is diluted by bad-faith actors: spammers,
trolls, partisans, which leads to the value of the whole system
decreasing.

\textbf{We can avoid babbling equilibrium only because there's some
human cost to generate new content.}

\textbf{Identifying quality by content vs by provenance.} We can
distinguish two ways of evaluating the quality of an object: the
content, e.g.~the text or data contained, and the provenance, e.g.~the
creator, their prior history, the path to receiving the object. Many
systems which try to identify the quality of objects have moved from
looking at features of the \emph{content} to instead looking at features
of the \emph{provenance}. Thus:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Search ranking.} Google's original ranking algorithm from 1998,
  pagerank, used information on provenance while their competitors
  primarily used information from content. Provenance was both (a) a
  better signal of quality; (b) more robust to adversarial
  actors.\sidenote{\footnotesize Google's project Panda, in 2012, additionally
    incorporated information about how often people would directly
    search for a site''
    (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Panda}{Wikipedia})).}
\item
  \emph{Spam filtering.} I believe spam filtering has moved from
  primarily using content signals to prmarily using provenance, often
  using whitelists and blacklists of domains, and the quantity of
  messages from a given account.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{surface-deep-structure-inference}{%
\subsection{Surface \& Deep Structure /
Inference}\label{surface-deep-structure-inference}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A simple model is that we do translation between surface and deep
  structure.
\item
  Then we can ask \emph{how deep} does an ML model represent the
  situation? Surface understanding allows interpolation, deep
  understanding allows extrapolation.
\item
  In fact a lot of human cognition is \emph{shallow}, but in some sense
  the way we reason presupposes the existence of a latent deep
  structure.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Q: How deep is the representation that an AI model has of the
underlying structure?}

\textbf{Simple model.} We have an observable artefact \(x\) and it
represents some deep thing \(v\). E.g.:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  x = sound , v = words
\item
  x = words , v = concept
\item
  x = image , v = thing depicted
\end{itemize}

Sometimes we can learn the mapping through observing both the artefact
and the thing, e.g.~hearing a sound and seeing a written word at the
same time. But sometimes the thing is never independently observed,
e.g.~words represent concepts, or an image representing the thing
depicted, and then we have to just learn some latent representation.

\textbf{Natural vs conventional representation.} We sometimes have a
simple well-defined problem with natural representations: infer bone
structure from an MRI; infer bird species from a photo; infer distance
of objects from a photo. There's a clear ground truth.

Conventional representations seem to be a bit different.

\textbf{Supply-side vs demand-side synthesis.} The current models are
\emph{supply-side,} i.e.~they take existing artefacts and do variation
on them. You could imagine alternatively \emph{demand-side}, where you
start from user tastes and explore them.

\hypertarget{synthesis-fakes}{%
\subsection{Synthesis \& Fakes}\label{synthesis-fakes}}

\textbf{Software to detect fakes may make things \emph{worse} in the
long-run.} E.g. consider some computer systems to detect quality:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Text analysis to detect spam.
\item
  Text analysis to detect the author of a manuscript (stylometry).
\item
  Text analysis to detect plagiarism.
\item
  Image analysis to detect forged art.
\end{itemize}

These can all help detect forgeries. However if the software is
available to everyone then the forger will use it too and will tweak
their forgeries until they pass the test. As a consequence: (1) the
software is less useful to discriminate between real and fake; (2)
humans will find it harder to detect fakes because the subtle
differences they would normally rely on have been eliminated.

Thus the net effect on forgery detection will be \emph{negative}: it
helps the poacher more than it helps the gamekeeper.

\textbf{Applications.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Spam}: Spam or phishing emails often have odd wording, at least
  in part because they're written by non-native speakers or people
  unfamiliar with the context. Software could correct these mistakes and
  make it much harder to distinguish them from ordinary emails.
\item
  \emph{Authorship detection}: Forging a manuscript or writing under a
  psuedonym will become easier because software can change your text to
  fit a different style.
\item
  \emph{Plagiarism}: If you copy someone else's text then software can
  reword it until the copying is undetectable.
\item
  \emph{Fake artworks}: If you're forging a Rembrandt then software will
  be able to tell you whether your painting has any noticeable
  differences in style from other Rembrandts, and so make it difficult
  for experts to tell whether it's genuine.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Formalizing the argument.}

Say we're trying to predict spam from a vector of features,
\(P(spam|x_1,\ldots,x_n)\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Adding a new feature, \(x_n\), should always make the classifier
  better, holding fixed sender behavior.
\item
  In an adversarial equilibrium the spammer will choose \(x\) such that
  their spam is indistinguishable from real email.
\item
  As a consequence there is no long-run benefit to either party from
  adding a new feature.
\end{enumerate}

Given this basic model we can add extra complications:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Suppose some features are costly for a spammer to fake, e.g.~they
  lower the click-through rate, then this lowers the returns to spam,
  and so should decrease the amount of spam.
\item
  If spammers are more strategic than non-spammers then the medium-run
  effect of adding a feature \(x_n\) will make things strictly worse for
  non-spammers: the classifier will be \emph{all} false positives.
  However in the long-run (when the classifier updates with new weights)
  the effect will be neutral.
\end{enumerate}

Additional observation: when computers get better at detecting and
creating spam it now becomes harder for \emph{humans} to detect spam
because the features that they ordinarily use will no longer be
informative.

\textbf{Effect on centralization.} On both sides there are now greater
returns to fixed costs, i.e.~life gets harder for both low-tech poachers
and low-tech gamekeepers. So we might expect a consolidation and
professionalization on both sides.

\hypertarget{models-of-the-world-true-models}{%
\section{Models of the World / True
Models}\label{models-of-the-world-true-models}}

\textbf{A series of simple structural models.} Models which generate the
artefacts in the world (AKA the data generating process):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Independent draws.} Each \(x_i\) is an independent draw, so
  there's nothing you learn from other datapoints.
  \[P(\bm{x})=\prod_{t=1}^n P(x_t)\]
\item
  \textbf{Markov.} Each draw \(x_i\) is a function only of the previous
  \(x_{i-1}\). So the previous datapoint is a sufficient statistic. Note
  that if you reverse a Markov distribution it's also Markov.
  \[P(\bm{x})=P(x_1)\prod_{t=2}^n P(x_t|x_{t-1})\]
\item
  \textbf{Multiple vocabularies.} Suppose there are two possible
  unobserved speakers, \(v\in\{0,1\}\), and each has a vocabulary
  \(P(x|v)\). Each word is generated IID given the speaker:
  \[P(\bm{x})=\sum_{v\in\{0,1\}}\ut{P_v(v)}{speaker}\prod_{t=1}^n \utt{P(x_t|v)}{vocabulary}{given speaker}\]

  \emph{This can generate relatively complicated contingencies.} E.g. in
  the following case, if we observe A then \textasciitilde50\% chance
  it's followed by C, if we observe B then \textasciitilde50\% chance
  it's followed by C, but if we observe A and B then 0\% chance it's
  followed by C.

  \textbf{Joint Gaussian.} Fully characterized by some covariance
  matrix. Implies all conditional .
  \[P(\bm{x})\propto \exp\left( (\bm{x}-\mu)\Sigma^{-1}(\bm{x}-\mu) \right)\]
\item
  \textbf{Slow-varying noise.} Some factor which influences all other
  raw features in the same way. E.g. brightness of illumination, shade
  of illumination, distance, openness of pupil. Simplest model is
  there's a common shock: \(x_i = v_i + e\). But this does not require a
  hierarchical model, we can interpret this with a linear model: it
  would find a component corresponding to \(e\), \& every other
  component would be de-meaned.
\item
  \textbf{Temporal components.} We have a sequence \(x_1,\ldots,x_t\),
  each element can be written, \[x_t = v_t + u_t + e_t\] where each
  component has some degree of autocorrelation, e.g.~divide into
  slow-moving, fast-moving, and idiosyncratic noise. Given
  \(x_1,\ldots,x_t\) we want to predict \(x_{t+1}\) and we can draw a
  nice little network to represent the different components.
\item
  \textbf{Ray tracing.} A simple world with a few objects, each with a
  position and an orientation, and the light source has a position and
  orientation. Then the pattern of pixels on your eye is entirely
  determined. A model can factor the rich input into a small number of
  influences; some are important and fed upwards, others are thrown
  away.
\item
  \textbf{Meanings vs expressions.}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Propositions are mapped 1:n into sentences. We observe a sentence and
  try to infer the proposition.

latent space.}

If everything is joint normal then a linear model is ideal (and you
don't need a hierarchical structure).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the distribution is multi-modal then you want a non-linear model

\hypertarget{strengths-weaknesses-of-neural-networks}{%
\section{Strengths \& Weaknesses of Neural
Networks}\label{strengths-weaknesses-of-neural-networks}}

\textbf{Most language models generate text one word at a time.} They are
trained to predict the next word (or token) given a prior sequence of
text. To generate new text they are given a prompt and then iteratively
generate words based on their prediction of what will come next at each
step.

\textbf{GPT does badly constructing text which has a ``backwards''
structure.} Some types of writing have a structure such that there is an
important piece of information at the end and clues are scattered around
at the beginning, like a detective story. When humans write this type of
story they often first decide on the ending, then write out the clues.
We could expect that language models will do badly on this type of task
and it seems they do.

\textbf{Cases where chatGPT4 does a bad job:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{``Narrate a wordle quiz, showing the entire sequence of guesses,
  responses, and the final solution.''}
\item
  \emph{``Narrate a wheel-of-fortune game showing the entire sequence of
  guesses, responses, and the final solution.''}
\item
  \emph{``write a logic puzzle, giving a set of clues such that it's
  just possible to infer the solution.''}
\item
  \emph{``Supply the last words of some famous quotes, omit the first 3
  words of each.''}
\end{itemize}

In the first 3 cases GPT confidently states a list of clues but then
cannot find a solution which satisfies them all. At the end GPT will
often contradict itself. In the last example.

\textbf{Cases where chatGPT4 does a surprisingly good job:} Against my
prediction.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Write a sentence with the order of the words reversed.}
\end{itemize}

GPT seems to do a reasonable job, however when generating backwards text
the text seems significantly less fluent than the forwards text. This
perhaps implies that the backwards-text is partly generated through an
autonomous system, rather than merged with the same processes that
generate ordinary text.

\textbf{Cases I haven't tested:} But I predict that GPT would do a bad
job.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Write a short detective story with clues and an ending which

\hypertarget{why-are-these-problems-hard}{%
\subsection{why are these problems
hard?}\label{why-are-these-problems-hard}}

It was not clear to me at first what is the common feature among cases
that are difficult for GPT to generate.

\textbf{Generating one word at a time is not \emph{logically}
impossible.} If you know the full probability distribution over words
then you can generate a random draw by generating each word given the
conditional distribution up to that point. This is because the full
joint likelihood can be factored into a series of conditional
likelihoods without any loss of generality:
\[P(x_1,...x_t)=p(x_1)\times p(x_2|x_1)\times \ldots \times p(x_t|x_1,...,x_{t-1}).\]

However if you want to sample the \emph{most probable} next word, rather
than a \emph{representative} draw, then drawing words one-at-a-time is
not equivalent to drawing a whole phrase. E.g. consider the following
distribution over two-word phrases: the most likely phrase (``white
cat'') is not the same as the phrase that would be generated by choosing
the most-likely word at each step (``black dog'').

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``black cat'', p=25\%
\item
  ``black dog'', p=30\%
\item
  ``white cat'', p=35\%
\item
  ``white dog'', p=10\%
\end{itemize}

There is some literature on strategies to correct for bias in generating
the most-probable completion, e.g.~the ``beam search'' algorithm will
search multiple steps ahead down the search tree to help find the
highest-likelihood completion.

However I'm doubtful that this is the cause of the biases discussed
above. If this was the problem then I think the problem would go away
when you turned temperature up to 1 (i.e.~generate a word based on each
word's probability, rather than choosing the most-likely word.)

\textbf{Some examples of problems that are easier backwards.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Guiding a rocket.} Suppose you need to hit a certain spot, and
  trying to save on fuel. You have a phase diagram showing how momentum
  and gravity will affect your path from one point to another. It's
  often easier to solve this problem backwards, i.e.~tracing a path from
  destination to origin.
\item
  \emph{Solving a maze.} You can represent a maze with an undirected
  graph of edges and vertices: one vertex is the start, one vertex is
  the end. You can describe ``difficulty'' as the average number of
  edges between start and end in a depth-first search, choosing edges
  randomly. Often mazes are easier backwards than forwards, e.g.~you can
  go from the end to the start without making any choices, but going
  from the start to the end requires many choices.

  To have a tighter analogy with text generation lets make it a
  \emph{directed} graph, and acyclic. This makes it more like creating a
  sentence.
\item
  \emph{Justifying text.} This is a classic language-related
  optimization problem that has dependence in both directions: choosing
  whether to break the line at a given point depends both on the
  previous and following lines.
\item
  \emph{Matrix representation.} You might be able to draw a diagram with
  rows and columns, and probabilities in cells, to illustrate cases
  where it's easier to choose X then Y, than to choose Y then X.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{It's not feasible to represent the full probability
distribution, there must be some compression.} For any sequence of words
or pixels there is a combinatorial explosion in the number of states, so
realistically a brain or language model always representing some
\emph{compressed} version of a probability distribution. The compression
might be lossy or not.

\textbf{We can compress a distribution with conditional independence.}
Suppose we have a joint distribution of \(P(A,B,C)\). We say that B and
C are conditionally independent of A if we can write the following:
\[P(A,B,C)=P(B|A)P(C|A)P(A).\]

When conditional independence holds this implies that it's \emph{cheap}
to represent the full probability distribution (cheap in storage terms).
The full distribution can be represented with a cardinality of
\(n_A+n_An_B+n_An_c\) instead of the much larger \(n_An_Bn_C\).

\textbf{Given a factorization, some conditional probabilities are
computationally more expensive than others.} Suppose we are using the
factorization given above, so our primitives are \(P(B|A)\), \(P(C|A)\)
and \(P(A)\). Then generating a random draw from the joint distribution,
\(P(A,B,C)\) requires just a single draw from each of the three
component distributions. Similarly it's trivial to draw from \(P(B|A)\)
and \(P(C|A)\). However if we wish to draw from \(P(B|C)\) this requires
a loop: we keep drawing from \(P(A)\) and \(P(C|A)\) until we get a
match for C, then we draw from \(P(B|A)\).

\textbf{Q: does this explain the problems?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Wordle.} To explicitly represent a distribution over every
  permutation of 5-letters would be very expensive (\(26^5\)
  permutations = 12M). It's cheaper to store 10,000 words, and then each
  letter is independent conditional on the word:
  \[P(l_1,l_2,l_3,l_4,l_5)=P(l_1|w)P(l_2|w)P(l_3|w)P(l_4|w)P(l_5|w)P(w),\]
  This representation is lossless and has about 10X lower cardinality
  (\(5*26*10000\)=1.3M). Given this representation it's cheap to
  generate random draws of words or of letters. However it's expensive
  to randomly draw one letter conditional on another,
  e.g.~\(P(l_1|l_2)\) requires repeatedly drawing from \(w\) until you
  get a match on \(l_2\), then drawing from \(P(l_1|w)\).

  The same basic analysis would apply to Wheel of Fortune.
\item
  \textbf{Backwards phrases.} Suppose there's some distribution over
  two-words phrases, \(P(w_1,w_2)\). This can be represented with one
  big joint distribution, or a conditional and unconditional, either
  \(P(w_1)\) and \(P(w_2|w_1)\), or \(P(w_2)\) and \(P(w_1|w_2)\). Each
  of these three storage systems has equal cardinality, however if the
  most common tasks are to draw sequentially, i.e.~to draw \(P(w_1)\)
  and \(P(w_2|w_1)\), then it seems reasonable that we would store the
  data in that format. However this means that it is expensive to
  generate a phrase backwards: i.e.~to generate \(P(w_1|w_2)\) requires
  repeatedly drawing from \(P(w_1)\) and \(P(w_2|w_1)\) until you get a
  match on \(w_2\).
\item
  \textbf{Logic puzzle.} Consider a logic puzzle where you're given a
  set of clues about the relationship between a set of people and a set
  of houses, and you have to figure out which person lives in which
  house. Given the true assignment, then each clue is conditionally
  independent. However given a subset of the clues, the other clues are
  not conditionally independent: it is computationally difficult to
  generate the other clues because you have to take draws from the space
  of possible solutions until you get a match for the subset you're
  given. (Here I'm glossing over whether the relationship between clues
  and solutions is logical or factual, but I don't think the distinction
  is crucial, either way there is some cognitive cost in doing each
  comparison.)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{additional-notes}{%
\subsection{Additional Notes}\label{additional-notes}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Conditional independence with joint normal variables.} If a
  set of variables are conditionally independent then we can fully
  represent the distribution with \(n\) variables instead of \(n^2\).
  Suppose we have a bunch of observables which are jointly normally
  distributed:
  \[f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\utt{f(x_1|v)\cdots f(x_n|v)f(v)}{conditional}{independence}\]

  When we want to infer one from a set of the others then we need to use
  the covariance matrix which has dimension \(n^2/2\) (Schur
  decomposition). However given the conditional independence we know the
  full covariance matrix can be expressed just with covariances against
  the hidden state (\(\rho_{x_i,v}\) for \(i=1,\ldots,n\)), and so we
  only need to keep track of \(n\) variables.

  This doesn't help you if you're always trying to predict the same
  thing, e.g.~always predicting \(x_4\) given \(x_1,x_2,x_3\) then there
  is no efficiency in first calculating \(v\). However there must be .
  (TODO: find expression for \(E[v|x_1,\ldots,x_n]\))

  \[\xymatrix{
                                 & x_1\ar[dr]    & \\
         v \ar[ur]\ar[r]\ar[dr]  & x_2\ar[r]    & \hat{v}\ar[r] & x_4\\
                                 & x_3\ar[ur]}
   \]
\item
  \textbf{Conditional independence with binary variables.} Suppose we
  have \(x_1,\ldots,x_n\) binary observables, but there's some hidden
  binary state \(v\) so we can write:
  \[P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\utt{P(x_1|v)\cdots P(x_n|v)P(v)}{conditional}{independence}\]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{It could be sequential structure.} Suppose we have some
distribution P(A,B) but we find it is cognitively easier to sample from
P(B\textbar A) than from P(B\textbar A), even though knowledge of the
first would imply knowledge of the second. This might happen if we
always encounter A before B, and almost never the other way around.

In this case there's nothing special about the \emph{logical} structure
of the distribution.

\hypertarget{general-observations}{%
\subsection{general observations}\label{general-observations}}

\textbf{Written text often begins with a conclusion, \& this is a trap
for chatGPT.} When humans write we often state our conclusion first and
then our reasoning. Sometimes ChatGPT imitates this, but because it has
stated the conclusion without first discussing the reasoning it is
highly likely that it will make a mistake, and then the reasoning will
be a mess.

E.g. I asked chatGPT to solve a logic puzzle and it started the answer
with the sentence \emph{``this puzzle is a paradox and has no
solution.''} Next it worked through the logic which led to a solution.
The final paragraph was a jumble, contradicting itself about whether a
solution existed.

\textbf{Properties of distributions.} Suppose we have P(x1,\ldots,xn).
Then there are some properties we can put on that joint distribution:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Independent.} P(x1,\ldots,xn)=P(x1)\emph{\ldots{}}P(xn)
\item
  \emph{Markovian.}
  \(P(x1,...,xn)=P(x1)*P(x2|x1)*P(x3|x2)*...*P(xn|xn-1)\)
\item
  \emph{Conditionally independent.}
  \(P(x1,...,xn)=P(x1)*P(x2|x1)*P(x3|x1)*...*P(xn|x1)\). Implies that
  once you've generated \(x1\) then you can generate all the others
  independently. But if you do it in reverse then generating \(x1\) is
  hard because it'll depend on every other realization.

post about greedy generation}. I talked about how (1) if choosing the
most-likely next word then would be very bland; (2) intuitively would
struggle generating things backwards.

I have a question for people who know something about language models
(e.g.~GPT).

In short: if LLMs are generating the most-likely next word, wouldn't
that lead to characteristic differences from human writing?

I'm sure this must be discussed somewhere but I couldn't find the right
keywords with Googling.

Some examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Wouldn't an LLM always make the details in a story be the most-likely
  details? E.g. characters would be called John Smith, who live in New
  York and have 2 children. Individually each detail is highly propbable
  but collectively they're highly improbable. (You could add noise with
  temperature\textgreater0 but then you sacrifice model fit presumably).
\item
  Wouldn't it be hard for for an LLM to write a detective story?
  Detective stories are typically written back-to-front: the writer
  decides the murderer then scatters the clues about. I would guess it's
  very hard to write a detective story front-to-back, you'd need an
  extraordinarily powerful LLM.
\item
  Wouldn't it be hard for an LLM to write a joke? E.g. a joke where
  there's something hidden in the setup then revealed in the punchline.
\item
  A generalization of the above. A human can equally well write ``the
  hash of A is B'' and the ``the reverse hash of B is A''. But a
  sequential LLM could only ever write the first one.
\end{enumerate}

I think the common observation tying these together is that maximizing
the probability of a sequence isn't the same as maximizing the elements
sequentially. I.e. suppose you choose words w1 and w2 to maximize
P(w1,w2). That will not be the same as first choosing w1 to maximize
P(w1) then w2 to maximize P(w2\textbar w1).

\textbf{Q: how will generative AI affect communication?}

\textbf{Useful to distinguish between two types of quality:
\emph{shallow} and \emph{deep}.} Shallow quality is something that can
be immediately judged, deep quality depends on more thought or relation
to other things.

Shallow qualities: pleasing, tasty, amusing, refreshing. Could also say
it's ``self interpreting'' or ``self contained''.

Deep qualities: true, .

Other words: self-interpreting, self-contained. For deep: credence good.

\textbf{Generative AI is good for shallow qualities, but bad for deep
qualities.}

\textbf{Observations:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{User feedback is good for evaluating shallow quality, bad for
  evaluating deep quality.} User satisfaction is a good way of judging
  objects by qualities that can be immediately judged, e.g.~food taste,
  movie entertaingness, music rhythm.However when the quality is deep
  then user satisfaction can be a poor guide: e.g.newspaper articles
  (you don't know whether it's true when you rate it), doctor (you don't
  know whether it's effective when you rate it).
\item
  \textbf{Shallow qualities are only \emph{locally} shallow.} You can
  map out someone's immediate responses to movies, music, food,
  literature. But those responses are themselves functions of prior
  exposure. Not sure what this implies.
\item
  \textbf{Shallow quality is informationally insensitive, like a liquid
  asset.} Deep quality is like equity: less liquid than debt.

\textbf{LLM ability bounded by the convex hull of human abilities.}

The Pareto frontier of what LLMs can do is bounded by the \emph{convex
hull} of what can be done by people in their training set.

I.e. compared to any individual person an LLM can do a lot more things,
but if there's nobody in the world can do some task then an LLM cannot
do that task.

(one semi-exception: an LLM can do a set of tasks much faster than any
individual human, so an LLM can do any difficult task that can be
decomposed into a set of simpler tasks, which is not generally true for
humans)

\textbf{Submitting generated content.} Submitting reddit comments,
submissions to literary magazines, letters to the editor, scientific
papers to ARXIV.

It used to be that you could tell from a skim that a certain amount of
effort went in (could plagiarize but has some cost).

New equilibrium perhaps you have to pay money to submit anywhere.

\textbf{Are artefacts under-determined or over-determined.}

  \emph{under-determined:}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Eliezer Yudkowsky on whether GPT would exceed human

next-word-prediction requires \emph{superhuman} intelligence, unlike
GANs which try to predict a draw from the whole distribution. / His
examples: (1) a sequence (hash,text); (2) a sequence
(product,prime1,prime2). / These are sequences that are trivial to
generate but very hard to do left-to-right.

Not sure whether this is true. Distinction between being able to
generate (A,B), vs able to generate B and A\textbar B.

\end{enumerate}

\emph{Recommendations: Abandon generative models in favor
joint-embedding architectures.}

\textbf{Q: suppose writing is \emph{intentionally} bad, will an LLM be
able to extract meaning?}

A lot of academic writing seems intentionally obscure. Classic case: you
have a small true statement, but it's dressed up in big words so it's
easy to get the impression that it's major. (castle/keep; motte/bailey)

(see discussion of Pinker on political science writing.)

\textbf{Can't ask about GPT's beliefs or understanding.} People ask
whether GPT knows its limitations: this isn't a well-formed question,
GPT is a next-word predictor, if it has beliefs those beliefs vary with
the prompt. The beliefs of chatGPT could be a bit more consistent but
they're whatever are the latent beliefs of a bland FAQ-style voice.

\textbf{When generating you typically want the \emph{most likely}
completion, not a \emph{representative} completion.}

Temperature=0 means generate the \emph{most likely} next token.

If we're using the model to answer questions we want the \emph{most
likely} outcome. Suppose we want GPT to tell us a fact or to generate
code, and the model internally generates 3 answers: A with 60\%, B with
35\%, C with 5\%. Then I think we want the model to always choose A. It
would be a real pain if it returned the 5\% probability answer 1/20
times.

It partly depends on the source of the uncertainty, there are two
sources: (1) model uncertainty; (2) intrinsic stochasticity in the
world. E.g. given a phrase, what's the next word? It could be that, in
the world, this phrase is \emph{always} followed by a certain word, but
the model hasn't had enough training data to figure that out. Or it
could be that this phrase is followed by a distribution of other words.

Cases where you'd prefer temperature\textgreater0: when you want the
model to generate \emph{multiple} outputs and you're going to choose
among them.

Q: are there cases where you're generating a single output and want
temperature\textgreater0? I can't think of one.

\textbf{There's probably lots of latent structure that humans haven't
discovered.}

Advances in human knowledge have been more about organizing existing
knowledge, than about discovering new knowledge. And computers seem to
be very good at organizing existing knowledge and discovering latent
structure.

E.g. Arisotle/Jigsaw: that the moon goes around the earth, earth around
the sun, sun around the stars. That animals act to survive, and humans
are a type of monkey. That gravity pushes everything down, energy is
preserved, momentum preserved. The rules of logic and of calculus.
Bayesian inference.

\textbf{What else might we find?} Relationship between diet and health;
patterns in human history.

\textbf{Models trained on human creations will retain the human stain.}
If models are trained on human artefacts which reference the world then
anything they learn about the world will retain the failures of
humanity. E.g. if they're trained on human paintings they'll learn to
paint shadows in the shitty way that humans paint shadows.

A computer will \emph{prefer} an imperfect solution to a problem because
a perfect solution wouldn't fit the data.

\textbf{Deep question: if models are trained on human performance, will
they be able to outperform humans?} If humans have some ceiling of
performance, can computers go above that ceiling?

\textbf{The hard things are easy: computers will make \emph{better} art
than humans.} Many of the achievements of artists are in making
artefacts which satisfy many different criteria simultaneously, e.g.:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Making a poem that rhymes and scans but also means something
  important.
\item
  Making a music .
\end{itemize}

\textbf{LLMs imply much of written communication is redundant.}

People often say they're using LLMs to generate a lot of text from a
small prompt, e.g.~writing emails, articles, academic papers, grant
proposals, computer code. This implies the informational content of this
text is much smaller than the text used.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For written communication perhaps implies that all organization tend
  to puff up their communication more than necessary.
\item
  For computer code perhaps implies that we could be designing more
  efficient computer languages.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The weaknesses of LLMs are actually its strengths.} Many of the
examples of GPT weaknesses are where it hallucinates/confabulates given
some incorrect starting text. But we can evaluate the completion by two
metrics: (1) whether it's true; (2) whether it's the most-likely
completion given the starting text.

\textbf{On synthesis.}

\textbf{Where LLMs will perform well vs badly.}

It's all hitting us from a very unexpected angle. Our previous
experiences with new technologies unfold very differently. We can make
generalizations about culture and science and technology, but this is
cutting things from an entirely different angle.

\emph{I think it won't work where there's a subtext.}

In many parts of life the discourse is treacle: product of two forces --
weak and strong. If ML just learns to reproduce the ordinary
\emph{surface} forms then it won't learn how things work.

Expect to be good at these:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Good at computer programming.}
\item
  \emph{Good at uncontroversial factual stuff.} -- the dates of
  celebrity marriages, tax rates.
\end{enumerate}

Expect to be bad at these:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Bad at answering a simple question from scientific literature.}
  E.g. answering how strong is the evidence for saturated fat and
  cholesterol. The literature is written using indirect phrasing -- the
  surface writing is non-sequiturs and inconsistent (cargo cult)(such as
  classical p-values) -- those who are conversant with norms can reason
  well about the underlying truth, but what's put into language is very
  partial.
\item
  \emph{Bad at discussing Egyptian civilization and interpretation of
  ambiguous evidence.}
\item
  \emph{Bad at stating the price elasticity of tobacco consumption.} It
  won't be able to think about the short-run and long-run elasticities
  in an intelligent way and see through the opacities of how people
  write about these things.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Captcha technology will get much worse.} Pictures with traffic
lights.

Analysis: core of good-faith actors, diluted by bad-faith actors
(spammers , trolls, partisans), leads to decline in community.

\textbf{History of individual creation.} every nightclub an orchestra,
every home a piano, every town a portrait painter, a wood carver , a
tailor and seamstress , packs of stonemasons // as cost of ornament
declined: short-run ornament everywhere, long-run ornament disappeared :
// Victorian living room and Victorian public building w plaster and tin
ornament everywhere , bauhaus made sick.

\textbf{Hairdressers and tattoo artists are the holdouts for mechanical
reproduction.} They're the people who are still doing creative work in
small communities.

\textbf{Nominal reality in media} -- tabloids celebrities , Hollywood
star magazines , wrestling , soap operas and romance novels ; celebrity
drama as staple of demand for media, ``I love mess.''

\textbf{ChatGPT is just reminding us of things we already know.} Will
says he asks GPT to write a pitch for work, and he can compare it to his
own pitch to see what he'd forgotten. ChatGPT doesn't have any more
knowledge than he does, but it's more accessible. Will has to go fishing
in his memory and hope he catches the big fish; alternatively he can use
chatGPT to just drain the entire lake.

\subsection{artefacts that are under-determined and
over-determined}\label{artefacts-that-are-under-determined-and-over-determined}}

\textbf{Can define redundancy in two ways:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If you remove some data, how well can you reconstruct removed data?
\item
  If you remove some data, how well can you reconstruct the latent
  factors?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Examples of over-determined/redundant.}

\emph{Redundancy in letterforms:} If you slice off either the bottom
half or the top half of a line of printed text then you can still read
it. Partly because of redundancy in letterform, partly because of
redundancy in spelling. (Put another way: if you had uniform priors over
shape of letters, or over the spelling of words, then you wouldn't be
able to predict).

\emph{Redundancy in words:} If you jumble the letters within each word
in a sentence it's still pretty easy to read. Because both (1) letters
in a word are not uniform, (2) words in a sentence are not uniform.

\emph{Redundancy in communication:} Most long documents can be
summarized down to something short.

\emph{Redundancy in photos:} If you occlude half of the pixels in a
photo you can usually reconstruct pretty well.

\textbf{Examples of under-determined.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Infer reflectance from luminance.} You see luminance, but you
  know it's a product of reflectance and illumination, \& you can only
  separate out those two with conjectures.
\item
  \emph{Infer 3D image from 2D.} Given a 2D image there are infinitely
  many 3D configurations which that could represent.
\item
  \emph{Bistable stimuli.} An image is consistent with either of two
  latent configurations (Necker cube, blue-gold dress). A sound can be
  consistent with either of two words being read.
\item
  \emph{Ambiguous phrases.} You can construct a text so that it has two
  quite-different but consistent interpretations. E.g. in a comedy of
  misunderstanding you have a series of phrases which perpetuate the
  double meaning.
\item
  \emph{Meaning of words (lasso).} A noun can refer to many different
  entities, and a sentence can mean many different propositions. We
  infer the meaning from context plus cooperative principle.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Observations.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{All perception is under-determined.} You see only a
  projection, you need to infer the higher-dimensioned reality. Only
  possible with some priors over reality.
\item
  \textbf{Reality is sparse.}
\item
  \textbf{Sparsity implies redundancy.} The space of all possible
  artefacts is sparse (contains clusters), and so implies redundancy:
  (1) if you observe one property can infer the other properties; (2) if
  you encounter unusual combination of properties then agglomerate it to
  the nearest cluster.
\item
  \textbf{Most human artefacts are redundant.} If you add noise or you
  remove some data, you don't hurt interpretation much: letterforms,
  words spelling, word pronunciation, written communication.
\item
  \textbf{Redundancy implies interpretation will survive noise.} If you
  add some noise it doesn't matter.

\subsubsection{LLMs could cause substantial improvements in our
classifiers}\label{llms-could-cause-substantial-improvements-in-our-classifiers}}

My impression is that the new large-language models (LLMs) are routinely
beating specialized models at their own benchmarks.

This implies we could see substantial improvements in our classifiers,
e.g.~it seems plausible we could have dramatic improvements in
predicting whether a tweet is toxic, etc. It seems likely that these
models could do better than human raters. We might be able to get rid of
paid raters \emph{entirely} and instead just feed the LLM a small
``golden set.'' (For a decade Zuckerberg has been promising that AI
would dramatically lower the burden on human raters and I always thought
it was hot air, but now I believe it).

The new models might also get far better at predicting the quality of a
tweet, which could lead to big increases in ranking quality.

\hypertarget{llms-could-synthesize-new-content}{%
\subsubsection{LLMs could synthesize new
content}\label{llms-could-synthesize-new-content}}

\textbf{Right now} GPT3 can already produce moderately funny tweets (!),
at the cost of about 0.2 cents/tweet.{[}1{]}

This could dramatically change the economics of all media, and Twitter
might be the first in the firing line because text is the easiest thing
to generate (though images are getting pretty close).

It seems to me likely that over the next few years a lot of passive
media consumption will be replaced by AI-generated content: sitcoms,
Instagram, TikTok, ads. An algorithm will be able to generate highly
engaging content tailored to anybody.

Even if the average synthetic tweet is only moderately funny, it's easy
to run them through a filter of humans (or other ML models) to find the
most entertaining. So I think it's likely \textbf{already} possible to
generate an enormous volume of entertaining content at extremely low
price.

One vague feeling is that, if synthetic content becomes
indistinguishable from organic content, then perhaps it'll become
relatively more important to have a \emph{chain of trust} or
\emph{verification}. That people will be particularly sensitive to
verified authorities, because there's no other way of telling whether
something is legitimate or not. (I guess people freaked out about
deepfakes a few years ago, and nothing much has happened since then. I
have a feeling that these new models are going to be more disruptive but
I should try to think that feeling through more.)

{[}1{]}: OpenAI charges 6c/1000 tokens for using their best model
(DaVinci v2). They say 1000 tokens is roughly 4000 characters or 750
words. If 20 words/tweet then 0.2c/tweet.

\subsection{old summary}\label{old-summary}}

\textbf{Unlike humans, computers are equally good at recognizing and
synthesizing.} Humans can recognize whether an object satisfies some
property but we struggle to synthesize a new object with that property.
We can recognize whether a joke is funny, a melody is pretty, or a
drawing looks like a cat. It's much harder to write a funny joke,
compose a pretty melody, or make a drawing that looks like a cat. This
asymmetry is because much of our knowledge is pre-conscious (AKA
encapsulated): it can be used to recognize things but it's hard to use
that knowledge for other purposes.

However computers have comparable ability to both recognize \emph{and}
synthesize. In recognition computers are approaching human-level
ability, e.g.~transcribing speech, identifying objects in photos,
labeling text. However unlike humans their ability to synthesize has
grown in proportion to their ability to recognize. They can synthesize
speech, create photos with identifable objects, create text that
satisfies some property.

\textbf{Synthesis could immediately replace much human labor.}
Illustrators, designers, copywriters, musicians.

\textbf{Synthesis could replace a lot of entertainment.} People spend
around 6 hours every day consuming entertainment: TV, Netflix, YouTube,
Tik Tok, Twitter. It seems likely that computers will soon be able to
produce reasonable-quality substitutes for these at essentially zero
price.

\textbf{Synthesis will make fakes harder to detect.} It will become
harder to discriminate between spam and non-spam emails, between
plagiarized and original text, and between forged and genuine
manuscripts.

\textbf{Synthesis will disrupt communication and make provenance more
important.} A lot of communication between people relies on being able
to discriminate between real and fake. If computers can generate content
that's indistinguishable from the real thing then it'll become
relatively more important to check the provenance of everything we see
or read.

\textbf{Synthesis may make people value creative work less.} When
technology makes something easier to create then it often loses its
value.

language to another, or from prose to poetry, etc.. They can change the
style of a picture: impressionist, etc.. / However it's not clear that
they can do substantial maniplations \emph{within} the semantic content.

\begin{quote}
``1) intuitive reasoning is generative and instantaneous (as opposed to
thoroughly discriminative across all possible alternatives); 2) the
space of such reasoning is infinite, and thus requires the full scope of
natural language to describe them (as opposed to a fixed set of
predefined labels to choose from); 3) intuitive inferences are
predictive in nature, and are therefore almost always defeasible with
additional context; and 4) intuitive inferences draw from rich
background knowledge about how the physical and social world works (as
will be elaborated below).''

they can memorize, maybe compose, but not generally reason with.''
