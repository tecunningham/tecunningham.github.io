**ARGUMENT**

   1. _AI will shrink the types of communication that are self-validating_

      Some messages are "self validating" in the sense that just seeing the message itself is strong evidence for the claim it makes, without knowing where the message came from. A piece of text is not self-validating because it's easy to lie, but a photo can be self-validating.

   2. _Most communication is not self-validating, yet is accurate_






**APPLICATIONS**

   fake announcement by government

   fake announcement by celebrity

   fake leak from government

   fake 

   fake message from friend










**TERMS**

- provenance
- self-interpreting
- self-validating
- watermarked
- cryptographic watermark

**ANALOGIES**

- *anti-forgery measures in letters*: watermarked paper, signature, fingerprint, using a code, signature on the envelope over the seal, sealing wax.
- *anti-forgery measures in documents*: watermark, UV light, hologram, filigree.
- *codes.* 


**MISC.**

- *"the camera never lies"* -- 1880s used when people said their photos didn't look like them. The first known usage of the phrase in print was someone saying that the idea is obviously false, i.e. that the camera obviously can lie.

- _bad guys have two strategies:_ (1) compromise the channel of communication; (2) create fakes. In general you need to do both, they're complements.
