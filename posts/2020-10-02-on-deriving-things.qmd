<!-- TO DO: thin this out, cut out all the filler and just leave the really juicy ones. -->

<!-- TO ADD: nothing true is surprising, just you have the wrong analogies, it's all true -->

<!-- TO ADD: Going to sleep I cracked something , take the integral vertically instead of horizontally ; for a few months I would save some juicy problem to contemplate as I drifted off ; -->

I've spent a lot of time trying to prove things.

: With diagrams and algebra, back and forth between clipboard whiteboard blackboard & keyboard.

I can't talk about what it's like for a good mathematician but I can talk about it for a hack.
: I can prove true & interesting things occasionally but only after wallowing in it for a long time, and after a half-dozen proofs of things that I later realize are not interesting or not true & sometimes neither.

Perhaps 1/3 of the time is actually concentrating on the problem.
: If it's writing or programming I can just bring up a window and type away. If it's deriving things then my mind is constantly drifting, trying to find some other path to go down -- in reverie, doodling Zeus, refilling my pen, looking something up.


I'll be writing out an equation for the 3rd time and suddenly a dusty image will be released.

: A sparse park in Manchester, a man who blanked me in a corridor in London, a cheese shop in Stockholm. Quietening the brain to concentrate on just one thing and the background noise becomes audible. I hear the mice scratching in the walls. Not just the familiar memories, unfamiliar long-lost memories come out too.
: Beer at the dreary Birkbeck bar: we were all around 30 but still grasping around for things to say to each other to fill up an evening with. When we heard the kids roaring by the pool table we all looked up.
: Saturday morning on the way back from the vegetable market in Farringdon. I sit down with a sandwich in a churchyard and I see my German neighbors are there too. I'm self-conscious that my loneliness is exposed.
: Making Will's grandmother a shandy of beer and lemonade. Noticing the shadows of the roses in her garden, how they would change when I stood near them, the proximity of my own shadow would somehow make the shadows of the roses come into focus.


Sometimes the goal is to maximize the distance between the assumptions and the conclusion.
: I'm trying to make it seem more impressive. At first the starting point and end point are within sight of each other, and I hack away at either side, loosening the assumptions, tightening the conclusions, until the path stretches as far as possible.
: I sometimes end up chasing what *looks* impressive. I twist the wording of the assumptions to make them seem weaker than they are, the conclusions to seem stronger, or hide ancillary assumptions in the body of the derivation. Looking back to some of my old papers I see signs of this and I'm ashamed of it.

Often I'll over-estimate what I can accomplish.
: I'll have some cocky confidence that, this time, I can prove something I've failed to prove before. Or I'll have a sketch and decide that it's good-enough, that I can fill in the details later. Then later get a sickening feeling discovering that it's really nothing, the bits omitted from the sketch were exactly the difficult parts. The voice in my head that causes these over-optimistic judgments causes other griefs in my life I think.

My desk is covered with notes: should write up what I have or push on towards the summit?
: It's a dangerous tradeoff. In retrospect it seems like I've often made the wrong decision: too-often tried for the summit, failed, and then left without good notes about what I tried. I come back to make another attempt and see my old footsteps and regret that I didn't spend more time hammering nails into the rock.

There are a half-dozen different things I need to keep ambiguous.
: I'm not sure which disambiguation will be the right one - whether to use strict or weak preferences; whether the numbering should start at zero or one; whether naturals or wholes or integers. Making a decision at one stage has implications for others. This part is Sudoku, finding something which fits many constraints.

Sometimes a gap opens up between what's important and what's orthodox.
: If I make an assumption that is somewhat stronger than typical then everything is much more elegant and it feels like I can keep focus on what's important. But then I get memories of being in seminars and seeing the speaker making an unorthodox assumption and how the energy drains out of the room.

I take a problem and present it to my intuition to see if it recognizes something.
: I show it from different angles: vary the notation, write worked examples, draw arrow diagrams, draw venn diagrams, hoping that one of these approaches will trigger a memory of seeing this type of thing before.
: I walk around the house checking the windows and doors. I check whether the answers are in the right units: dollars/person, quantity/year, and I check whether the signs go in the right direction.


Eventually the relief of finding the hidden door.
: Suddenly I see the inequalities holding down variables like saxophone keys, which gives me the lemma: a condition for a set of inequalities between the elements of two vectors to imply an inequality between the sums of the vectors. I don't need to write it down, I can take a break and go for a run, it's enough to remember the idea of saxophone keys. Later I find out this is called Hall's marriage theorem.

I lose track of which way the inequality should be pointing, left or right.
: My intuition doesn't give me a strong signal so I just choose one and stick with it hoping that once I arrive at the conclusion I can work backwards and fix the directions.
: Margaret Bray told me that, when she worked correcting Stiglitz's proofs in the 1970s, she would sometimes find an odd number of sign errors instead of an even number. When that happened she would tell him it and he would quickly rewrite the discussion of that result: substituting an intuitive explanation of why the effect of $\theta$ on F was negative for what had been an explanation of why the effect of $\theta$ on F was positive.

On a good day it's like swimming in cold water.
: I don't want to get in but once I'm in I don't want to get out. Once my chair is firmly pushed in at the desk I don't want to get up to get a snack, to check the mail, I don't want to go to the bathroom, I'll be working through proofs while shaking my legs trying to stretch my bladder out.
: I'm a bit unwilling to start working on a revision but I know that once I'm back in the middle of it I'll see flaws in it and want to fix them, and it's difficult to stop working on it.

On a bad day I'm rotating slices of a Rubik's cube.
: I'm checking to see if it's solved then rotating again in some other direction.

I get flashes of recollection of other peoples' seminars and papers.
: They seemed so boring at the time and now my paper seems so similar to theirs.

The ideal state of mind has both (1) the clarity of fresh eyes; and (2) the suppleness of familiarity.
: For that reason it makes sense to spend a long day on the problem and not drag it out.

The feeling that a proof is in sight is distinct from other pleasures.
: It's final and discrete. Every decision in my life could turn out to have been a mistake in retrospect, but a proof is different. Very likely everything I've proved has been proved earlier and better but that doesn't do much to diminish the satisfaction.

<!-- 9.  Writing $\bar{k}$ reminds me of k-bars (hard candy in NZ), and the bar-kays (Stax records soul group). -->

Weaselly unworthy thoughts bubble up.
: I find myself thinking that a reader will be impressed by the quantity and the complexity of the proof, and give me credit for that.

When I'm trying to concentrate on something, & empty my mind, my weasel thinks of something I should order on Amazon.
: I can suppress that. My weasel tries to get me to look up how to do a LaTeX symbol that would be useful (delta-over-equals). I can suppress that. Weasel sees a pair of brackets that could have an extra space: I give in and go fix the brackets. But once I've given in it becomes easy to follow the Weasel on to other naughty things. And then after a while the Weasel tells me that it's almost lunchtime: I look back on my 3-hour block of time and it looks like swiss cheese.

I'm a grown adult but my concentration is still not under my control.
: I put out treats for it, entreating it like a dog. Teach it bad habits. Give in to its whims.

Sometimes I'm stumbling through equations trying to derive one from another but I have lost track of what they mean.
: Like going through a room in the dark grasping for a door handle. I want to go back and draw some diagrams to get an intuition of what's going on, some mental picture, but sometimes I try and try and nothing comes.

When I switched from programming to studying economics I missed those numb hours that would pass by.

: Some people seem to get into that state when they're deriving things but it's difficult for me to achieve that.
: When you're programming you get incremental feedback: you can see the mountain peak and you're slowly getting closer to it. With proofs you're going through the jungle and you don't know if you're getting closer or farther away. You could be on the brink of emerging into a clearing or it could be months more in the forest.

Why am I doing this?
: As I'm feeling around a problem I think of a guy I knew from seminars at Harvard who would pause when a new slide came up and then nod quietly when he understood. Why do I spend my time at this when I'm so far from being the best? Am I doing this for intrinsic or extrinsic reasons? One instinct is to untangle the threads of means and ends to see where they lead, another instinct tells to leave it tangled.

I took PTO for a month to prove some results.
: The first week I kept regular hours, I worked on pieces in a logical order, I didn't check my phone. By the third week I was sitting on the bed at 10 in the morning eating corn chips scrolling through Twitter. I took a day off and the energy returns the following day, it's strange that it's so predictable.

In Tel Aviv I would swim in the sea in the mornings.
: By the third week I was still going down to the beach, getting in the water, and starting to swim, but after 30 seconds I would let my legs fall to the sand and just walk through the water for a bit, staring into space and thinking. Then I would remember to start swimming again.

I switch between two modes: is this true? how do I show people it's true?
: In the second mode it's just trying to keep everything straight to nail it down but then occasionally a sickening feeling arises that it's not my clumsiness that's holding me back but perhaps the thing isn't true after all, and I have to return to the first mode.

Reading through an old draft like a landlord returning to his estate after a long trip.
: To be reminded of the state of things. I'm more often surprised unpleasantly than pleasantly. My memory must be pickling things in a sweet vinegar.

Coming back to writing a paper after 5 years at Facebook I had a different kind of confidence.
: Old anxieties were about failing to do things in the orthodox way. Now I feel that if it makes sense to me I won't be embarrassed by it. I might be wrong but I'm not a fraud.

The representation of a problem becomes gradually more abstract.
: I start with a full set of equations, then I gradually omit things that seem inessential, and I introduce a new symbol which feels like it denotes something but I'm not sure what, and then another higher level of abstractin, a jenga tower almost to the ceiling. I'm holding it very delicately and it's crucial not to lose that concentration as I can see it teeter. Sometimes I stare out the window too long and when I look back down at the page the symbols no longer make sense: was this a matrix and that a vector? Why was I multiplying them together in this weird way? Ah shit.

My coauthor suggests modifying an assumption in the setup.
: Taking apart a Lego car to rearrange the unsatisfactory front wheels but it's hard to anticipate all the downstream consequences of that; I don't remember all the considerations I had in mind when I put together the front wheels.  <!-- Rotating a slice of Rubik's cube in to complete the yellow face while only half paying attention to the state of the other 5 faces. -->

I'm always comparing myself, and necessarily.
: Am I clearer sighted than I was last month? My decision about whether to attempt to solve this problem depends on that judgment. I see that the problem I'm attempting is one that was notably not solved in a paper by Benabou and Tirole: whether I should give up now depends on how I assess my ability compared to theirs. I've spent two hours trying out different matrices to see if they have a certain property, looking for a generalization about which matrices satisfy it, I still haven't got one and now I don't recall why I felt this was important -- how much do I trust my decision to go down this road, and at what point do I go back to reconsider whether this problem is worth solving?



<!-- 15. **A Miami hotel parking lot at dusk.** -->

<!-- 18. **When I'm working I have a vision of the structure I'm going to build,** it feels forgivable to make a mess while I'm working. I have a confidence that each of these things will coalesce. The confidence an entrepreneur projects to their employees up to the day that the bailiffs arrive. -->

<!-- 20. **Success gets success.** My imagination of a referee reading the paper: "jesus what is this? what a mess." That thought sucks the strength out of me and makes me vulnerable to distracting thoughts; also makes me more vulnerable to grandiose voices -- trying to impress the referee. -->

<!-- 15. **I read through the paper and I change a semicolon to a comma;** I read it again and remove the comma; I read it again and add a semicolon. -->

<!-- 3. **Working my way towards my conclusions I have to pass obstacles** -- a canyon, a dragon, a moat. When it's going well it's a thrill, I defeat them one by one, I'm on a roll and I don't want to get up to have lunch. -->

<!-- 3. **For each conclusion I find a few different sets of assumptions that are sufficient, and for each set of assumptions I can find a few different conclusions that are implied.** I want to find the weakest assumptions that implies the strongest conclusion. Finding the right choice requires being satured in the whole problem: I can't just spend an hour a day, I need to collect all the pieces into my brain to be aware of the beginning, the middle, the end. -->


#                          Some things I proved

1. **[How to interpret experiments with two outcomes](https://joshkim.org/files/InterpretingExperiments.pdf):** your posterior depends on priors about correlations between treatment-effects, and priors about correlations in noise.

2. **[When trade-off curves look like ellipses](https://tecunningham.github.io/posts/2023-10-23-pareto-frontiers-experiments-ranking.html).** If you're ranking items by predictions, e.g. ranking by $p(A)+\beta p(B)$, and the predictions are calibrated, with Gaussian distribution of probabilities, then the overall tradeoff between $A$ and $B$ will be an ellipse, equal to an isovalue of the joint distribution of $F(p(A),p(B))$.

3. **[Modularity in the brain will cause characteristic inconsistencies in decision-making](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=MDB_DgkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=MDB_DgkAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC).**

4. **[Implicit preferences can be inferred from intransitivities in binary choices.](https://jondequidt.com/pdfs/paper_implicit.pdf)**
