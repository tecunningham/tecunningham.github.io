They notice that micro theory uses Bayesian agents and econometrics is non-Bayesian but hard to think about how to reconcile that. They think of Bayesian econometrics as more complicated estimators, but in fact seen rightly it's a simplification of over-complicated stuff, and is helpful in informally assessing evidence.\n",

In most practical cases the interpretation of the experiment outcome will depend on our prior over treatment effects. We can write out some simple applications of this framework (for compactness we write everything as if we had a mean-zero prior, $E[\\bm{t}]=0$):\n",

However it's often unclear the best way to define this function. It is useful to think of $f(\\cdot)$ as a forecast of the long-term impact on fundamental business goals, which can then be calibrated based on the variances and covariances above. We should treat this forecast as a simple extrapolation, but one that can be overriden when we have additional information, especially when the forecast has a low $R^2$.\n",

        "   \n",
        "1. **Fundamental tradeoffs.** A launch rule expresses the company's fundamental values: e.g. willingness to trade-off revenue against the quality of service provided. In addition launch rules are often adjusted to help reach specific goals for a team, e.g. increasing DAU by 0.2% while not harming quality.\n",
        "2. **Inference.** A launch rule is based on noisy signals of true causal effects, thus it incorporates inference, often putting weight on metrics that not valuable in themselves but proxies for valuable things that are hard to measure.\n",
        "3. **Forecasting.** A launch rule is aiming at long-run effects while usually based on short-run experimental results, thus incorporates a forecast.\n",
        "4. **Network effects.** A launch rule based on user-level experiment results, but aiming to maximize aggregate outcomes, must account for network effects.\n",
        "5. **Commitment/Fairness.** Engineers and Data Scientists will often ask for an explicit commitment to a launch rule to help their own decision-making. A launch rule is typically expected to be *fair* in some sense: e.g. to be independent of the identity of the person who ran the experiment, even if the person's identity is in fact good predictor of the long-run outcome.\n",

        "**Recommendation: treat launch rules as forecasts.** I think it's best to divide launch decisions into three parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Choose a set of *proximal* metrics.** These are the metrics on which we are confident we can detect our experiment's effect, meaning the measured impact will be close to the true impact. The proximal metrics will vary depending on the experiment, e.g. Notifications experiments have reliable effects on DAU, other experiments do not. To determine whether a metric is moved we can use the fraction of a given class of experiments that have a statistically-significant effect on that metric: if the share is greater than 50% then we can be confident that the estimated effect is close to the true effect.^[Precisely: if the distribution of effect-sizes is Normal with zero mean then having a statistically-significant effect in 50% of your experiments implies a shrinkage rate of just 10%.]\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Identify *conversion factors* between proximal and final metrics.** These tell us the best-estimate impact on final metrics given the impact on proximal metrics. Conversion factors can be estimated either from (a) long-running tuning experiments; (b) a meta-analysis of prior experiments with similar designs. This is essentially a *forecast* (you could call it a \"shipping forecast\") and the quality of the forecast can be evaluated statistically from prior experiments, and sometimes it will be appropriate to over-ride the forecast on the basis of additional information. Additionally the $R^2$ of prior forecasts helps calibrate how confident we should be about future forecasts.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Establish conversion factors between final metrics.**  E.g. we might say we'd put an equal weight on 1% DAU, 2% minutes/DAU, 5% posts/DAU, and 100% prevalence of spam.\n",

        "**Sometimes there's reason to constrain the use of priors.** When you treat the classical estimate as if it was a Bayesian estimate, i.e. a best-inference about the underlying value, this is similar in many ways to Bayesian inference with a completely flat prior. The Bayesian interpretation requires you to come up with a prior, but the shape of the prior is essentially a judgment call about what you think of as the nature of the existing evidence. The classical setup removes that judgment call and replaces it with a rigid rule. This can have two justifications:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The psychological justification** is that people have a weakness for misremembering their expectations, and thinking they predicted what actually happened -- the classical rule prevents you from doing that.\n",

        "\n",
        "You should think of the rules of significance-testing (insofar as they are used as inference, rather than inputs into Bayesian inference) as etiquette, not as statistics: i.e. we consider certain practices \"bad form,\" not because they're statistical malpractice, but because they're socially harmful.\n",

Because it approximates shrinkage with weak priors.** The Bonferroni test is rarely of direct interest -- i.e., we rarely care about the statistic \"maximum t-stat\" as a measure of the hypothesis \"all effects are zero.\"  Nevertheless the technique is popular because it helps, indirectly, to address a different problem with multiple tests: that we typically have weak priors when we're doing a lot of tests, and so heavy shrinkage is appropriate. Calculating Boneferroni p-values, *effectively* applies something like heavy shrinkage: they tell you to apply relatively stricter thresholds to your individual tests. In short: the number of experiments -- whether 2, 20, or 50 -- is irrelevant, the appropriate inference should depend only on the strength of priors about experimental effects.\n",

But they approximate empirical Bayes -- i.e., what we discussed above, that you can shrink more effectively if you can estimate the distribution of true effect-sizes.\n",
