#              Summary

**Artificial neural nets (ANNs) work by finding latent hierarchical structures in data.** 
:  If you feed them images they will learn to represent both low-level features (brightness, contrast, texture, line direction) and more abstract features (objects, light direction, style). If you feed them text they will learn to represent both low-level features (vocabulary, sentences, paragraphs, chapters) and more abstract features (tone, syntactical rules, logical structure, facts).

: It is difficult to know how much of the performance of neural nets reflects them learning deep abstract representation vs just doing shallow permutations of the training data, in part because the training sets and the parameter spaces are so large (each has around a trillion elements). Whatever the depth of representation, it's clear that the outputs are useful for a broad range of practical tasks.

   <!-- 2. **Neural nets' mistakes can be interpreted as reflecting their hierarchical structure.** The mistakes that ANNs make can often be understood as side-effects of their hierarchical structure in representing information. The same is true of humans: many illusions and biases can be understood as side-effects of a hierarchical processing of information. -->
   <!-- examples: upside-down faces; contrast effects; backwards logical problems ; specifically: low-level information not accessible to the high-level, it gets thrown away; but can just.  -->

**It seems plausible that neural nets will find latent structures that humans haven't discovered yet.**  
: They are good at discovering hidden structure: they might find a visual way of discriminating between male and female chicks (something that humans cannot do), they might find a new assocation between diet and cancer.

   <!-- More broadly a lot of human intellectual history could be thought of as finding latent structures (the cycles of the planets, the laws of physics, the structure of evolution), and computers might discover other deep patterns that we have not yet figured out ourselves. -->

**Generative models produce what is *probable* not what is *good*.** 
: Many generative models (both text and image) can be thought of as generating data that is *likely* conditional on a prompt. Thus they will produce an output that has good qualities (logical, harmonious, perspicacious) just to the degree that the training data has those good qualities, but not because they are trying to achieve those good qualities. The typical training data does have good qualities compared to random data.

: If flaws in the training dataset are random (orthogonal to each other) then generative models can do better than the average human. If flaws in the training set are consistently in the same direction then generated content will reproduce the same flaws.

:  The situation is more complicated for models that have been fine-tuned with human feedback, e.g. chatGPT which has been which is trained with an additional layer of explicit rating for quality (RLHF).

   <!-- The computer will look like it's exhibiting goal-directed behaviour but it's actually just imitating the goal-directed behaviour of humans and thus will inherit our flaws. -->
   <!-- An ML model trained on human-drawn pictures will produce pictures in which the shadows are messed up in the same way that humans mess up their shadows, and the ML model will have no sense that this is a mistake. An ML model trained on bad code from bad programmers will produce bad code and see no problem with it. -->
   <!-- - An ML model trained on human reasoning will make mistakes about the same fraction of the time humans do: if it made fewer mistakes then it would be failing to match the data on which it's trained. -->

**Unlike humans, computers can use their representations to synthesize new artefacts.** 
: Human judgment has a notable asymmetry: we can easily recognize when an object satisfies a given property, but it's much harder to synthesize a new object that satisfies that property. E.g. we can trivially tell whether a joke is funny, or a poem rhymes, or a picture looks realistic, but we find it difficult to create a funny joke, a rhyming poem, or a realistic picture. This is sometimes attributed to the hierarchical and feed-foward nature of how the brain processes information.

:  Artificial neural nets do not suffer from the same degree of asymmetry. They can be reversed to synthesize new objects that satisfy a given property. This means computers will be able to do qualitatively different things that humans cannot do, even with the same amount of knowledge.

**Market structure: it seems plausible that OpenAI would become the dominant firm.** 

:  The costs in AI are mostly fixed costs and so we might expect an equilibrium with a single dominant firm whose pricing power is limited by the threat of entry from other firms.^[John Sutton's model of "endogenous sunk costs" seems a good fit: as the market gets larger the sunk costs increase, and so concentration does not fall.] I think there is an analogy to the economics of web search where Google is the dominant firm, but is threatened by other potential entrants, and for that reason can only capture a small share of the total surplus generated. In most industries the first-mover retains their position for a long time so it seems plausible that OpenAI will become the dominant firm in AI. There also seem to be substantial economies of scope across use-cases, thus it doesn't seem likely that there would be different firms specialized for different use-cases (the same is true for search: it has not fractured into different markets).

**The effect on entertainment: platforms produce their own synthetic content.**
:  It seems likely that computers could synthesize adequate-quality entertainment: stories, porn, music, television, video clips, computer games. The typical adult spends perhaps 5 hours/day on passive entertainment and much of it is fairly generic, meaning it could be generated by a computer and it would be similarly entertaining, and the audience wouldn't be upset. The firms likely to synthesize the best content would be those with access to large datasets on both content and engagement, e.g. Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Netflix. Some platforms which are two-sided might become mostly one-sided because once they synthesize their own content they no longer need to attract creators. Platforms which host communication between real-life friends (e.g. FB, IG, WA) would retain a competitive edge because that content cannot be so easily displaced by synthetic content.

:  In the short-run we could expect computers to produce content that is similar to existing content, but in the medium-term they might learn what features make it maximally engaging, in a similar way to how headline-writers have learned how to maximize peoples' propensity to click. As a consequence it's hard to anticipate how entertainment might evolve.

:  Peoples' tastes depend heavily on their experience: people like what they're familiar with. As a consequence we might expect that in the short-run synthetic content will resemble what people already consume, but in the long-run it could get very weird (just through the evolution of tastes, setting aside any technological advances).

**The effect on art: computers could make art that is better than humans can.**

:  I think there's a compelling argument that computers will be able to make art that is *better* than humans can in certain ways. The success of an artwork is often judged by its ability to satisfy multiple different criteria simultaneously. For example a good picture both (a) depicts a specific scene, and (b) is a harmonious arrangement of colours. A good poem both (a) tells a story, (b) rhymes, and (c) scans. A good piece of music has symmetry at many levels. It's easy for humans to recognize when an existing artwork successfully satisfies multiple criteria but hard to create a new artwork that satisfies those criteria. Neural nets allow computers to learn to represent the characteristics of artworks, and so it seems plausible they would become better than humans in being able to find permutations that satisfy them.^[Computers have been better than humans at solving well-specified combinatorial problems for 70 years. The difference with newer generations of algorithms is that they can now perceive categories that humans learn unconsciously: harmony, rhythm, representation, semantics, etc.]

**The effect on programming: increased efficiency.**

:  GPTs are already being used a lot by programmers, I think their primary uses are (1) saving time looking up knowledge, e.g. the names of function calls; (2) filling in boilerplate details.

:  It seems paradoxical that a short prompt can be reliably translated into a long piece of code because it implies that the generated code contains redundant information. Why would programming languages have so much redundancy? However there is an asymmetry between writing and reading code: it makes sense to write code with the details implicit (it saves time) but read code with the details explicit (it helps with debugging and confirming the logic).[^djikstra] It seems likely that NN-augmented code would have a bigger relative effect on the productivity of programmers with relatively less knowledge.

   [^djikstra]: Relatedly Djikstra argued that advances in mathematics were accompanied by formalizations of the notation ([On the foolishness of "natural language programming"](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html), )

**The effect on adversarial problems: help the bad guys more than the good guys.** 

:  In adversarial situations like spam-detection computers will help both spammers and spam-detectors, but they seem likely to shift the balance in favor of the spammers because of the relative advantage computers have at synthesizing over recognizing content (compared to humans). Humans can intuitively discriminate between real and fake artefacts, but that ability will become less valuable when computers have learned the cues that humans use to make those discriminations.

**The effect on communication systems: greater reliance on *provenance* than on *content*.** 

:  When evaluating a message we can use signals either from the content or the provenance (i.e. where the message come from). Many communication systems already rely heavily on provenance, e.g. spam detection relies heavily on the identity of the sender. However as generative ML improves we should expect equilibrium to move even further in the direction of provenance and reputation and away from content.

**The effect on employment.** 

:  LLMs are able to produce outputs that are near-indistinguishable from humans in many domains, so it seems likely it would displace humans.

      However previous computer technologies had much smaller effects on output and employment than were initially predicted: (1) in the 1950s many people thought optimization algorithms (e.g. linear programming) would greatly increase productivity but I think the effect was small; (2) in the 1970s many people thought that experts would be replaced by simple algorithms (e.g. linear regression), but I think the effect was small; (3) in the 1990s many people thought computers and the internet would greatly boost productivity, but I think the effect was small. 

      <!-- In each of these cases it was observed that computers made certain difficult tasks much easier. -->

<!-- big effects: agriculture and manufacturing have far smaller employment shares because of automation: combine harvester; machines to mass-produce and process goods -->

<!-- 
- **Computers are relatively better at *interpolating* than *extrapolating*.** Computers out-perform humans at tasks which are close to the training data, but under-perform when far from the training data. However they are rapidly getting better at extrapolating and it's difficult to predict the influence of improvements in algorithms, data, and model size.

#              Predictions

|                                                     |     |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Fraction of entertainment-time is synthetic in 2024 | 25% |
| Fraction of porn consumed is synthetic in 2024      | 50% |


**Illustration: mostly synthetic.** 

:  Generative models can already create illustrations to the quality of an above-average advertisement or children's book. I would guess that demand for illustration is pretty inelastic, meaning that increases in productivity decrease employment, so it seems likely that hundreds of thousands of people who currently work in illustration would find much less demand for their skills.

:  Precedents: 
   
:  (A) Mechanical reproduction of artefacts (printing press, colour reproductions, stamped decorations, recorded music) has led to a substantial loss of employment among artisans: scribes, carvers, musicians, typesetters.
   
:  (B) Electronic synthesis of musical instruments in the mid twentieth century has probably led to unemployment of musicians.

**Entertainment: mostly synthetic.** 
: People spend perhaps 10% of their waking life watching entertainment: television, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. It seems likely that 50% of this could be replaced by entirely synthetic content in 3 years. In the short run I guess ML will produce content that's indistinguishable from regular content but after a while it could get weird.

**Ads: mostly synthetic.**
:  These models could be used to create brand new ads designed to maximize propensity to click on them, or to buy the product. I think these could be quite powerful because (1) Facebook and Google already have databases with hundreds of millions of ads and trillions of interactions to learn from; (2) ML could experiment very efficiently to figure out what maximizes conversion rates.

:  In the past few years advertisers have been learning what makes people click: "1 simple trick for belly fat", "see this pimple pop", "see child stars now." Advertisers have always been doing they volume and granularity allows them to do it quicker. I expect ML accelerate it again, helping identify the sensitive parts of our brains which make us curious.

**Spam: no dramatic change.**

:  We can define "spam" as advertising trying to disguise itself as organic content. Over the last few decades spam has increased as the price of communication has fallen (SMS, email, social media).

:  Platforms have been able to keep it under control by looking for patterns in the *quantity* of messages: (a) detecting the same message being sent a million times; or (b) detecting that a million messages are all coming from a common source. New ML models will make it harder to distinguish based on content because it's cheap to make variations, though it will remain difficult to counterfeit the source.

<!-- **Informational content: not sure.** News, informative articles & videos, product reviews, celebrity gossip, discussion boards. -->

**Taste: shift towards aesthetic minimalism.**

:  The ability to cheaply generate new artworks seems likely to change tastes. I believe something similar happened in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the 19th century it became much cheaper to add ornamentat onto objects, e.g. printed patterns on clothes, machine-woven fabric, stamped tinwork, moulded plaster. In the early 20th century ornamentation gradually fell out of fashion and there followed a general taste for simple minimalist objects which has mostly survived until today.

#              Effects on Entertainment and Art

##              Historical Trends in the Economics of Creation

I think it's useful to compare the introduction of synthetic composition, AKA generative ML, to three prior technological changes which affected creation:

1. The introduction of synthetic materials.
2. The mechanical reproduction of artworks.
3. Photography.

**(1) The introduction of synthetic materials.** Early humans would make everything from wood, stone, and animal skins. We then gradually learned how to use metal, glass, oil, plastic, etc., and we can now create almost any combination of shape, colour, texture, taste, smell. 

   Despite the freedom we have, many everyday products are still faux-wood, faux-stone, and faux-animal skin. We seem to have cultural preferences that are shaped by historical circumstances and which last many generations. Put another way: consumption choices at a given point in time seem highly influenced by budget constraints from prior points in time.

   <!-- could add timeline of synthetic materials: metal, ceramic, glass, concrete, plastic -->

   <!-- NOTE: There's a perennial controversy about adapting designs to fit the materials. Some set of smug assholes are always there to argue that we should be maximizing things relative to our *present* constraints. But they mix up means and ends. -->

**(2) The invention of mechanical reproduction.** We have gradually invented many means of reproducing individual activities:

- 5000BC: cast metal into molds
- 3000BC: writing (reproduction of speech)
- 600BC:  printing
- 1000s:  printing with movable type
- 1800s:  colour printing
- 1840s:  photography
- 1890s:  recorded sound and music
- 1900s:  moving pictures
- 1930s:  colour film
- 2020s:  virtual reality

The equilibrium impact of mechanical reproduction depends on the preference for variety.[^VarietyModel] If people have a strong taste for variety, meaning people strongly prefer an idiosyncratic object over an object that is identical to others, then mechanical reproduction would have little impact. Taste for variety could come either from a strict preference for differentiation (different from what they're familiar with or different from their neighbours), or from each person having idiosyncratic needs (the degree to which tailored clothing is more comfortable than off-the-rack).

[^VarietyModel]: Suppose that goods come in various different varieties and you can consume a certain quantity of each variety. We can say that before mechanical reproduction you would produce exactly one unit of each variety, and after mechanical reproduction you could produce multiple units of an existing variety at a cost lower than producing a new variety.

Overall I think the preference for variety has not been sufficiently strong to prevent mass production from dramatically reshaping production and consumption. 

It used to be that every family or village would have its own musician, story-teller, tailor, painter, cook, carpenter, blacksmith. Now most of the creative work is done by few guys in New York or LA and packaged up for the rest of us. They compose a song, a story, draw a picture, design a jacket or a piece of furniture, or come up with a recipe, which is then reproduced and shipped to every house in the world. There are a few professions remaining where people do one-off creative work: hairdressers, chefs, tattoo artists.

Although demand for artisans has substantially shrunk there are still perhaps surprisingly many. Most cities still have professional orchestras and opera companies, there are still many professional artists.

**(3) Photography.** Since photography was invented drawing and painting have become much less focussed on realism. Instead popular drawing and painting tends to be stylized in one way or another.


##              Observations on Taste

**We live in a corner of the room** We value things that are familiar.

**Lowering cost will lower value.** Walter Benjamin: mass production caused the individual work to have less value. Similarly we should expect synthesis to render the *type* of work less valuable, not just the individual work.

**People like things that are superficially real.** We watch a lot of reality shows, true-crime, documentaries. They are constrained to be factual, but people don't really care if they're actually true. Professional wrestling, celebrity drama (Kardashians). All in a world of pretend-reality.

**People still go to concerts, despite record players.**

**People still want new music, despite old music existing.**

**Scarcity makes a thing more valuable.** Gold, diamonds, pearls, purple robes.

**Difficulty makes a thing more valuable.** Elaborate embroidery, elaborate carving. Ornament was valuable for thousands of years. Fell out of favor and minimalism became ascendant as ornament became cheap. (upward-sloping demand, Veblen good.)

**New technologies imitate the constraints of prior technologies.** Synthetic glass, rubber, margarine, music.



#              How Neural Nets Work

**Neural nets decompose a set of inputs into a hierarchy of latent components.** E.g. when given a set of images neural nets will discover they are best organized by object and pose and lighting. When given a set of text inputs they will be organized into language and syntax and a set of semantic features. Early neural nets would output a single scalar prediction but once a net has learned a latent representation we can also reverse the process and find inputs that match the output, e.g. generating images to go with text, etc..

**Neural nets work because the world is hierarchical.**

   They don't work as well when the data does not have a latent hierarchical structure, e.g. neural nets aren't particularly impressive with tabular or time-series data.

   They don't work as well when we have a small dataset: with a small dataset a "structural" model will tend to do better, i.e. effectively hard-coding the priors into the model, because with a small dataset there's less ability to discover the latent hierarchical structure.


##       How Artificial Neural Nets Work

A very simplified description:

1. **A model is a mapping from an input to an output.** An input is typically some high-dimensional data, e.g. text, photo, video, a sequence of DNA. The prototypical output is a low-dimensional prediction: e.g. predict what object is depicted in the photo, or what word comes next.

   However the models can also be adapted to output high-dimensional predictions, e.g. as in synthesizing pictures based off captions, or segmenting a photo into parts.

2. **A model consists of a pyramid of layers.** Each layer is a set of nodes. In the simplest case the bottom layer has one node for each element of raw input and the top layer has a single node which represents the prediction, and each layer is connected only to the layer below it. The state of the model can be represented by weights in the connections between each layer. Progressively higher layers are generally thought to represent progressively more abstract features of the data.^[![](images/2023-03-25-07-46-44.png)
   (Rough sketch of GPT-3 architecture but it needs to be redrawn: the numbers are wrong, and I think the wiring of the inputs is a bit wrong too.)]

3. **A model is trained by successive approximation.** The model weights are initialized at random then updated by iterating through a very large set of training data, often billions of items. After each trial the prediction error is calculated (the difference between prediction and outcome) and then weights are updated in the direction of the error ("gradient descent").


##       Why Artificial Neural Nets Work

**Neural nets discover latent structure in the input.** The standard story about neural nets is that they learn to factor the input into its most important underlying components.

Here are some intuitive ways in which data can be described as a combination of separate components.


| observable ($\bm{x}$) | latent ($\bm{v}$)                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| photo of object       | object depicted, orientation, lighting, exposure, background |
| photo of digit        | digit, size, orientation, width, aspect ratio, line width    |
| sequence of words     | language, dialect, subject, object, verb                     |


Formally we can think of latent factors as having informational power over observables, e.g. if we have a probability distribution over observables we can factor it as:

   $$P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\sum_{v\in V}\utt{P(x_1|v)\ldots P(x_n|v)P(v)}{inputs conditionally}{independent given $v$}$$

Where $v$ is a latent factor (or set of latent factors). This gives a more parsimonious representation of the structure of input, and allows us to easily generate conditional expectations, e.g. $E[x_i|x_j]$. The latent factors could be continuous, e.g. extracting principal components, or they could be discrete, e.g. words, phrases, tropes, dialects, types of animals.

Consider a very stylized task: an image of a random digit (0-9) with a random size and orientation. Given those three variables then every pixel is deterministic:

   $$P(\ut{x_1,\ldots,x_n}{pixels})=( \prod_i \ut{P(x_i|\text{digit},\text{size},\text{orientation})}{$\in\{0,1\},$, i.e. deterministic}) P(\text{digit})P(\text{size})P(\text{orientation})$$

   So we can reduce this high-dimensional set of pixels into just three latent factors.

<!-- TODO: add visualization of MNIST factorization -->

**The components are often organized hierarchically.** This simplest way of finding latent structure is to look for linear combinations of features that are the most predictive (principal components analysis). However neural nets greatly outperform these algorithms because of their hierarchical organization: the lower layers extract superficial features, the higher layers extract deeper features. The same hierarchical structure appears in the visual cortex: neurons in early areas seem to represent local or superficial features of the scene (colours, shadows, lighting), while later areas represent more abstract features (specific people seen, etc.).

LeCun gave a [talk](http://matt.colorado.edu/compcogworkshop/talks/lecun.pdf) circa 2015 where he says *"Deep Learning addresses the problem of learning hierarchical representations with a single algorithm"*.

**Hierarchical neural nets work because the world is hierarchical.** The fact that hierarchical ANNs work, and that our brains have a hierarchical, implies that the processes in the world which generate the input data are themselves highly hierarchical.

Property of hierarchical structure: *context-dependence*. When data is hierarchical then any individual feature is not very predictive of another feature, it all dependds on the context. E.g. the relationship between the color of an individual pixel and a word used in the label, or relationship between occurrence of one word in the input and another word. 

**Neural nets have performed much more succesfully than two alternative approaches:**

- *Hand-coded models.* Models where the hierarchical structure is explicitly hand-coded by the programmer.

- *Non-hierarchical models.* E.g. linear regression, where the computer learns the weights on different features but doesn't construct new features from the existing ones.


<!-- **Diagrams to show hierarchical structure in data.** Suppose a dataset is a set of points in (x1,x2,x3). Can we visually show how a hierarchical representation is different from a flat structure?

   1. No structure -- i.e. everything is uniform and independent.
   2. Flat structure -- each feature is normally distributed and there's a big covariance matrix.
   3. Hierarchical structure -- *not sure how to show this -- some online picture of "manifold"*.

##             Constraint Satisfaction

**Setup: choosing a vector to satisfy a set of constraints.** We have a sequence of parameters, $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ and there are some conditions $P^A(\bm{x}),\ldots,P^C(\bm{x})\in\{0,1\}$, and we want to satisfy all of them. E.g. (1) we're choosing a sequence of words that should satisfy constraints on syntax, rhyme, and meter; (2) we're choosing a matrix of pixels such that the picture looks like a pig and is symmetrical and in vaporwave style.

**Q: Can we derive an efficient order in which to choose elements?** Given the condition $P(\bm{x})$ can we say something about the efficient order in which to choose elements, e.g. it's less expensive to choose $x_i$ before $x_j$, than to choose $x_j$ before $x_i$?

**Q: Could a model do better than the training data?** Suppose the training data consists of $\bm{x}$ produced by people trying to satisfy the constraints. We think that neural nets are good at creating new instances that satisfy the constraints, but is there a sense in which a model trained on this data could do *better* than the data in the training set?

###          Examples

**Rhyming words.** You want to choose word 1 and word 2. Each word has its own constraint, plus the two words have to rhyme. The rhyming constraint can be represented as a block diagonal matrix (with suitable reshuffling of rows and columns). Here I have drawn the constraints such that there's only one solution (highlighted). You could also draw this such that there's a clear optimal order: suppose that there's no constraint on word 1, then it's best to choose word 2 first and word 1 second.

```{tikz}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.3, line width=1, fill=green]
   \draw (0,0) -- (10,0) -- (10,10) -- (0,10) -- cycle;

   \draw (4,4)--(4,5)--(5,5)--(5,4)--cycle;
   \node at (5,11) {combined constraints};

\end{tikzpicture}
```


**Rhyming couplets.** Suppose you have to choose 6 words, from a bank of 1000 one-syllable words, such that the words have this form:

      NOUN-VERB-NOUN
      NOUN-VERB-NOUN

and the two lines must rhyme. If your training set is entirely couplets that satisfy these criteria then you can factor the likelihood:

$$P(x_1,\ldots,x_6)=\ut{P_N(x_1)}{is noun}\ut{P_V(x_2)}{is verb}P_N(x_3)
      P_N(x_4)P_V(x_5)P_N(x_6)\ut{P_R(x_3,x_6)}{rhyme}.
$$

- *It's inefficient to solve this problem forwards.* If you choose words sequentially, from $x_1$ to $x_6$, just satisfying constraints up to this point, then you may choose a noun at $x_3$ which has no other rhymes. Then you've entered a dead end. So if you're searching for a solution to this problem (an $\bm{x}\in W^6$ that satisfies the constraints) then it's most efficient to start by choosing two nouns that rhyme, and then you won't have to backtrack.

<!-- could add verb agreement constraint: verb and noun must both be singular or both plural -->

**It is surprising that autoregressive LLMs can write decent rhyming poetry.** It seems like the logical structure would make it hard to write from front to back. I guess they're able to perform OK just because of the volume of training data. (AR-LLMs should avoid ever using "orange" at the end of a line, anticipating that it'll be hard to find a rhyme for it.)


###          Efficient Order for Solving

1. **If a constraint is separable then the order doesn't matter.** If we can write a constraint as
   $$P(\bm{x})=P_1(x_1)\times\ldots\times P_n(x_n),$$
   then we can just decompose and find a solution to each of these problems separately.

2. **If given a set of constraints, efficient to satisfy the low-cardinality constraints first.** Suppose we are given a set of constraints, $P^A,P^B,P^C$, and we want to satisfy all of them. It's efficient to first solve the constraints which are (1) unidimensional, and (2) low cardinality. E.g. suppose constraint A applies only to word 2, and it is only satisfied by a single word, then it's most efficient to choose word 2 first and choose word 1 next.


##             Venn Diagram Model (Recognizing vs Synthesizing)

**Suppose we have some high-dimensional space,** e.g. the space of all possible tweets, books, images, sounds. In that space we can define the subset of tweets that are funny, the set of images that look like a cat, etc.

We can make two generalizations:

1. **Humans are generally good at learning to recognize membership in a set, but bad at synthesizing new examples.** We can easily recognize whether a joke is funny, a melody is pretty, or a drawing is of a cat. But it takes us much more work to create a funny joke, a pretty melody, or a recognizable drawing of a cat.

2. **Computers are good at both recognizing membership in a subset and synthesizing new examples of that subset.**

**Why are humans bad at synthesis?** I think the basic reason is that the information used in recognizing membership is *encapsulated*, i.e. the information used to recognize objects is stored in pre-conscious parts of our brain, and for that reason cannot be used synthesize new instances. Some evidence related to this:

- *Impenetrability of perception.* In psychology it's a common point of view that perception is "cognitively impenetrable" or "informationally encapsulated", meaning that it makes inferences using only a subset of the information available. Pylyshyn (1999) says:^[Proponents of encapsulated perception: Helmholtz (1866), Pylyshyn (1980), Fodor (1983). I think there's a debate about the degree to which some top-down influences can affect perception but most people agree that there's substantial encapsulation, see Pylyshyn (1999).]
   
   > "a major portion of vision ... does its job without the intervention of knowledge, beliefs or expectations, even when using that knowledge would prevent it from making errors."

- *Moravec's paradox.* 
   - Moravec: “it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.”
   - Pinker: “The main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard.”
   - Minsky: “In general, we're least aware of what our minds do best," he writes, and adds “we're more aware of simple processes that don't work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly.”

**There are some cases where computers are bad at synthesis.** A computer can easily recognize whether a string satisfies a cryptographic property, e.g. if its md5 hash is the same as that of some other string, but it's much much harder to synthesize a string which satisfies this property. This is a case where the informational content is low but the computational cost is high.

##             Communication & Synthesis

**Communication systems rely on good-faith actors.** A common pattern is a communication system starts with a group of people who act in good-faith but is then is diluted by bad-faith actors: spammers, trolls, partisans, which leads to the value of the whole system decreasing.

**We can avoid babbling equilibrium only because there's some human cost to generate new content.**

**Identifying quality by content vs by provenance.** We can distinguish two ways of evaluating the quality of an object: the content, e.g. the text or data contained, and the provenance, e.g. the creator, their prior history, the path to receiving the object. Many systems which try to identify the quality of objects have moved from looking at features of the *content* to instead looking at features of the *provenance*. Thus:

1. *Search ranking.* Google's original ranking algorithm from 1998, pagerank, used information on provenance while their competitors primarily used information from content. Provenance was both (a) a better signal of quality; (b) more robust to adversarial actors.^[Google's project Panda, in 2012, additionally incorporated information about how often people would directly search for a site" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Panda))).]

2. *Spam filtering.* I believe spam filtering has moved from primarily using content signals to prmarily using provenance, often using whitelists and blacklists of domains, and the quantity of messages from a given account.

##             Surface & Deep Structure / Inference

1. A simple model is that we do translation between surface and deep structure.

2. Then we can ask *how deep* does an ML model represent the situation? Surface understanding allows interpolation, deep understanding allows extrapolation.

3. In fact a lot of human cognition is *shallow*, but in some sense the way we reason presupposes the existence of a latent deep structure.

**Q: How deep is the representation that an AI model has of the underlying structure?**

**Simple model.** We have an observable artefact $x$ and it represents some deep thing $v$. E.g.:

- x = sound , v = words
- x = words , v = concept
- x = image , v = thing depicted

Sometimes we can learn the mapping through observing both the artefact and the thing, e.g. hearing a sound and seeing a written word at the same time. But sometimes the thing is never independently observed, e.g. words represent concepts, or an image representing the thing depicted, and then we have to just learn some latent representation.

**Natural vs conventional representation.** We sometimes have a simple well-defined problem with natural representations: infer bone structure from an MRI; infer bird species from a photo; infer distance of objects from a photo. There's a clear ground truth.

Conventional representations seem to be a bit different. 

**Supply-side vs demand-side synthesis.** The current models are *supply-side,* i.e. they take existing artefacts and do variation on them. You could imagine alternatively *demand-side*, where you start from user tastes and explore them.

##             Synthesis & Fakes

**Software to detect fakes may make things *worse* in the long-run.** E.g. consider some computer systems to detect quality:

- Text analysis to detect spam.
- Text analysis to detect the author of a manuscript (stylometry).
- Text analysis to detect plagiarism.
- Image analysis to detect forged art.

These can all help detect forgeries. However if the software is available to everyone then the forger will use it too and will tweak their forgeries until they pass the test. As a consequence: (1) the software is less useful to discriminate between real and fake; (2) humans will find it harder to detect fakes because the subtle differences they would normally rely on have been eliminated. 

Thus the net effect on forgery detection will be *negative*: it helps the poacher more than it helps the gamekeeper.

**Applications.**

- *Spam*: Spam or phishing emails often have odd wording, at least in part because they're written by non-native speakers or people unfamiliar with the context. Software could correct these mistakes and make it much harder to distinguish them from ordinary emails.

- *Authorship detection*: Forging a manuscript or writing under a psuedonym will become easier because software can change your text to fit a different style.

- *Plagiarism*: If you copy someone else's text then software can reword it until the copying is undetectable.

- *Fake artworks*: If you're forging a Rembrandt then software will be able to tell you whether your painting has any noticeable differences in style from other Rembrandts, and so make it difficult for experts to tell whether it's genuine.

**Formalizing the argument.**

Say we're trying to predict spam from a vector of features, $P(spam|x_1,\ldots,x_n)$.

1. Adding a new feature, $x_n$, should always make the classifier better, holding fixed sender behavior.
2. In an adversarial equilibrium the spammer will choose $x$ such that their spam is indistinguishable from real email.
3. As a consequence there is no long-run benefit to either party from adding a new feature.

Given this basic model we can add extra complications:

1. Suppose some features are costly for a spammer to fake, e.g. they lower the click-through rate, then this lowers the returns to spam, and so should decrease the amount of spam.

2. If spammers are more strategic than non-spammers then the medium-run effect of adding a feature $x_n$ will make things strictly worse for non-spammers: the classifier will be *all* false positives. However in the long-run (when the classifier updates with new weights) the effect will be neutral.

Additional observation: when computers get better at detecting and creating spam it now becomes harder for *humans* to detect spam because the features that they ordinarily use will no longer be informative.

**Effect on centralization.** On both sides there are now greater returns to fixed costs, i.e. life gets harder for both low-tech poachers and low-tech gamekeepers. So we might expect a consolidation and professionalization on both sides.

#              Models of the World / True Models

**A series of simple structural models.** Models which generate the artefacts in the world (AKA the data generating process):

1. **Independent draws.** Each $x_i$ is an independent draw, so there's nothing you learn from other datapoints.
   <!-- $$P(x_t|x_1,\ldots,x_{t-1})=P(x_t).$$ -->
   $$P(\bm{x})=\prod_{t=1}^n P(x_t)$$

2. **Markov.** Each draw $x_i$ is a function only of the previous $x_{i-1}$. So the previous datapoint is a sufficient statistic. Note that if you reverse a Markov distribution it's also Markov.
    $$P(\bm{x})=P(x_1)\prod_{t=2}^n P(x_t|x_{t-1})$$

3. **Multiple vocabularies.** Suppose there are two possible unobserved speakers, $v\in\{0,1\}$, and each has a vocabulary $P(x|v)$. Each word is generated IID given the speaker:
   $$P(\bm{x})=\sum_{v\in\{0,1\}}\ut{P_v(v)}{speaker}\prod_{t=1}^n \utt{P(x_t|v)}{vocabulary}{given speaker}$$
   
   *This can generate relatively complicated contingencies.* E.g. in the following case, if we observe A then ~50% chance it's followed by C, if we observe B then ~50% chance it's followed by C, but if we observe A and B then 0% chance it's followed by C.

   |           | P(speaker) | A   | B   | C   |
   | --------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- |
   | speaker 1 | .49        | 0   | .5  | .5  |
   | speaker 2 | .49        | .5  | 0   | .5  |
   | speaker 3 | .02        | .5  | .5  | 0   |
   

4. **Joint Gaussian.** Fully characterized by some covariance matrix. Implies all conditional .
   $$P(\bm{x})\propto \exp\left( (\bm{x}-\mu)\Sigma^{-1}(\bm{x}-\mu) \right)$$

5. **Slow-varying noise.** Some factor which influences all other raw features in the same way. E.g. brightness of illumination, shade of illumination, distance, openness of pupil. Simplest model is there's a common shock: $x_i = v_i + e$. But this does not require a hierarchical model, we can interpret this with a linear model: it would find a component corresponding to $e$, & every other component would be de-meaned.

6. **Temporal components.** We have a sequence $x_1,\ldots,x_t$, each element can be written,
      $$x_t = v_t + u_t + e_t$$
   where each component has some degree of autocorrelation, e.g. divide into slow-moving, fast-moving, and idiosyncratic noise. Given $x_1,\ldots,x_t$ we want to predict $x_{t+1}$ and we can draw a nice little network to represent the different components.

7. **Ray tracing.** A simple world with a few objects, each with a position and an orientation, and the light source has a position and orientation. Then the pattern of pixels on your eye is entirely determined. A model can factor the rich input into a small number of influences; some are important and fed upwards, others are thrown away.

8.  **Meanings vs expressions.**

   - Propositions are mapped 1:n into sentences. We observe a sentence and try to infer the proposition.
   - Each proposition has subject, verb, object, and there's a probability distribution over propositions.
   Other factors:
      - Language (English/German/French)
      - Structure (active/passive)
      - Word choice (dog/mutt; man/male)

--------------------------------------------

**Q: What structure will neural nets do well with? A: clusters in latent space.**

If everything is joint normal then a linear model is ideal (and you don't need a hierarchical structure).

- If the distribution is multi-modal then you want a non-linear model (*sigmoid*)
- If the distribution is hierarchical then you want a layered model

Latent clusters:

- Objects: dog, cat, teapot
- People: grandma, uncle joe, pete the baker
- Body parts: ear, arm, lips, nose
- Individual words: in the space of letter combination.
- Languages/propositions.


#              Strengths & Weaknesses of Neural Networks

**Most language models generate text one word at a time.** They are trained to predict the next word (or token) given a prior sequence of text. To generate new text they are given a prompt and then iteratively generate words based on their prediction of what will come next at each step.

**GPT does badly constructing text which has a "backwards" structure.** Some types of writing have a structure such that there is an important piece of information at the end and clues are scattered around at the beginning, like a detective story. When humans write this type of story they often first decide on the ending, then write out the clues. We could expect that language models will do badly on this type of task and it seems they do.

**Cases where chatGPT4 does a bad job:**

- *"Narrate a wordle quiz, showing the entire sequence of guesses, responses, and the final solution."*
- *"Narrate a wheel-of-fortune game showing the entire sequence of guesses, responses, and the final solution."*
- *"write a logic puzzle, giving a set of clues such that it's just possible to infer the solution."*
- *"Supply the last words of some famous quotes, omit the first 3 words of each."*

In the first 3 cases GPT confidently states a list of clues but then cannot find a solution which satisfies them all. At the end GPT will often contradict itself. In the last example.

**Cases where chatGPT4 does a surprisingly good job:** Against my prediction.

- *Write a sentence with the order of the words reversed.*

GPT seems to do a reasonable job, however when generating backwards text the text seems significantly less fluent than the forwards text. This perhaps implies that the backwards-text is partly generated through an autonomous system, rather than merged with the same processes that generate ordinary text.

**Cases I haven't tested:** But I predict that GPT would do a bad job.

- *Write a short detective story with clues and an ending which retrospectively explains the clues.*
- *Write a ghost story with a twist that is foreshadowed.*
- *Write a joke that combines two elements.*
- *Compose a sudoku puzzle.*
- *State first the md5 hash of a string, then the string itself.*

NOTE: I expect all the difficult cases would be much less difficult if you added to the instructions something like "first write out the solution, then write the clues."

##             why are these problems hard?

It was not clear to me at first what is the common feature among cases that are difficult for GPT to generate.

**Generating one word at a time is not *logically* impossible.** If you know the full probability distribution over words then you can generate a random draw by generating each word given the conditional distribution up to that point. This is because the full joint likelihood can be factored into a series of conditional likelihoods without any loss of generality:
   $$P(x_1,...x_t)=p(x_1)\times p(x_2|x_1)\times \ldots \times p(x_t|x_1,...,x_{t-1}).$$

However if you want to sample the *most probable* next word, rather than a *representative* draw, then drawing words one-at-a-time is not equivalent to drawing a whole phrase. E.g. consider the following distribution over two-word phrases: the most likely phrase ("white cat") is not the same as the phrase that would be generated by choosing the most-likely word at each step ("black dog").

   - "black cat", p=25%
   - "black dog", p=30%
   - "white cat", p=35%
   - "white dog", p=10%

There is some literature on strategies to correct for bias in generating the most-probable completion, e.g. the "beam search" algorithm will search multiple steps ahead down the search tree to help find the highest-likelihood completion.

However I'm doubtful that this is the cause of the biases discussed above. If this was the problem then I think the problem would go away when you turned temperature up to 1 (i.e. generate a word based on each word's probability, rather than choosing the most-likely word.)

**Some examples of problems that are easier backwards.**

- *Guiding a rocket.* Suppose you need to hit a certain spot, and trying to save on fuel. You have a phase diagram showing how momentum and gravity will affect your path from one point to another. It's often easier to solve this problem backwards, i.e. tracing a path from destination to origin.

- *Solving a maze.* You can represent a maze with an undirected graph of edges and vertices: one vertex is the start, one vertex is the end. You can describe "difficulty" as the average number of edges between start and end in a depth-first search, choosing edges randomly. Often mazes are easier backwards than forwards, e.g. you can go from the end to the start without making any choices, but going from the start to the end requires many choices.

   To have a tighter analogy with text generation lets make it a *directed* graph, and acyclic. This makes it more like creating a sentence.

- *Justifying text.* This is a classic language-related optimization problem that has dependence in both directions: choosing whether to break the line at a given point depends both on the previous and following lines.

- *Matrix representation.* You might be able to draw a diagram with rows and columns, and probabilities in cells, to illustrate cases where it's easier to choose X then Y, than to choose Y then X.

**It's not feasible to represent the full probability distribution, there must be some compression.** For any sequence of words or pixels there is a combinatorial explosion in the number of states, so realistically a brain or language model always representing some *compressed* version of a probability distribution. The compression might be lossy or not.

**We can compress a distribution with conditional independence.** Suppose we have a joint distribution of $P(A,B,C)$. We say that B and C are conditionally independent of A if we can write the following:
   $$P(A,B,C)=P(B|A)P(C|A)P(A).$$

When conditional independence holds this implies that it's *cheap* to represent the full probability distribution (cheap in storage terms). The full distribution can be represented with a cardinality of $n_A+n_An_B+n_An_c$ instead of the much larger $n_An_Bn_C$.

**Given a factorization, some conditional probabilities are computationally more expensive than others.** Suppose we are using the factorization given above, so our primitives are $P(B|A)$, $P(C|A)$ and $P(A)$. Then generating a random draw from the joint distribution, $P(A,B,C)$ requires just a single draw from each of the three component distributions. Similarly it's trivial to draw from $P(B|A)$ and $P(C|A)$. However if we wish to draw from $P(B|C)$ this requires a loop: we keep drawing from $P(A)$ and $P(C|A)$ until we get a match for C, then we draw from $P(B|A)$.

**Q: does this explain the problems?**

1. **Wordle.** To explicitly represent a distribution over every permutation of 5-letters would be very expensive ($26^5$ permutations = 12M). It's cheaper to store 10,000 words, and then each letter is independent conditional on the word:
   $$P(l_1,l_2,l_3,l_4,l_5)=P(l_1|w)P(l_2|w)P(l_3|w)P(l_4|w)P(l_5|w)P(w),$$
   This representation is lossless and has about 10X lower cardinality ($5*26*10000$=1.3M). Given this representation it's cheap to generate random draws of words or of letters. However it's expensive to randomly draw one letter conditional on another, e.g. $P(l_1|l_2)$ requires repeatedly drawing from $w$ until you get a match on $l_2$, then drawing from $P(l_1|w)$.

   The same basic analysis would apply to Wheel of Fortune.

2. **Backwards phrases.** Suppose there's some distribution over two-words phrases, $P(w_1,w_2)$. This can be represented with one big joint distribution, or a conditional and unconditional, either $P(w_1)$ and $P(w_2|w_1)$, or $P(w_2)$ and $P(w_1|w_2)$. Each of these three storage systems has equal cardinality, however if the most common tasks are to draw sequentially, i.e. to draw $P(w_1)$ and $P(w_2|w_1)$, then it seems reasonable that we would store the data in that format. However this means that it is expensive to generate a phrase backwards: i.e. to generate $P(w_1|w_2)$ requires repeatedly drawing from $P(w_1)$ and $P(w_2|w_1)$ until you get a match on $w_2$.

3. **Logic puzzle.** Consider a logic puzzle where you're given a set of clues about the relationship between a set of people and a set of houses, and you have to figure out which person lives in which house. Given the true assignment, then each clue is conditionally independent. However given a subset of the clues, the other clues are not conditionally independent: it is computationally difficult to generate the other clues because you have to take draws from the space of possible solutions until you get a match for the subset you're given. (Here I'm glossing over whether the relationship between clues and solutions is logical or factual, but I don't think the distinction is crucial, either way there is some cognitive cost in doing each comparison.)

##             Additional Notes

- **Conditional independence with joint normal variables.** If a set of variables are conditionally independent then we can fully represent the distribution with $n$ variables instead of $n^2$. Suppose we have a bunch of observables which are jointly normally distributed:
      $$f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\utt{f(x_1|v)\cdots f(x_n|v)f(v)}{conditional}{independence}$$

   When we want to infer one from a set of the others then we need to use the covariance matrix which has dimension $n^2/2$ (Schur decomposition). However given the conditional independence we know the full covariance matrix can be expressed just with covariances against the hidden state ($\rho_{x_i,v}$ for $i=1,\ldots,n$), and so we only need to keep track of $n$ variables.

   This doesn't help you if you're always trying to predict the same thing, e.g. always predicting $x_4$ given $x_1,x_2,x_3$ then there is no efficiency in first calculating $v$. However there must be . (TODO: find expression for $E[v|x_1,\ldots,x_n]$)

   $$\xymatrix{
                                 & x_1\ar[dr]    & \\
         v \ar[ur]\ar[r]\ar[dr]  & x_2\ar[r]    & \hat{v}\ar[r] & x_4\\
                                 & x_3\ar[ur]}
   $$

- **Conditional independence with binary variables.** Suppose we have $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ binary observables, but there's some hidden binary state $v$ so we can write:
   $$P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\utt{P(x_1|v)\cdots P(x_n|v)P(v)}{conditional}{independence}$$

**It could be sequential structure.** Suppose we have some distribution P(A,B) but we find it is cognitively easier to sample from P(B|A) than from P(B|A), even though knowledge of the first would imply knowledge of the second. This might happen if we always encounter A before B, and almost never the other way around.

In this case there's nothing special about the *logical* structure of the distribution.

##             general observations

**Written text often begins with a conclusion, & this is a trap for chatGPT.** When humans write we often state our conclusion first and then our reasoning. Sometimes ChatGPT imitates this, but because it has stated the conclusion without first discussing the reasoning it is highly likely that it will make a mistake, and then the reasoning will be a mess.

E.g. I asked chatGPT to solve a logic puzzle and it started the answer with the sentence *"this puzzle is a paradox and has no solution."* Next it worked through the logic which led to a solution.  The final paragraph was a jumble, contradicting itself about whether a solution existed.

**Properties of distributions.** Suppose we have P(x1,...,xn). Then there are some properties we can put on that joint distribution:

1. *Independent.* P(x1,...,xn)=P(x1)*...*P(xn)

2. *Markovian.* $P(x1,...,xn)=P(x1)*P(x2|x1)*P(x3|x2)*...*P(xn|xn-1)$

3. *Conditionally independent.* $P(x1,...,xn)=P(x1)*P(x2|x1)*P(x3|x1)*...*P(xn|x1)$. Implies that once you've generated $x1$ then you can generate all the others independently. But if you do it in reverse then generating $x1$ is hard because it'll depend on every other realization.

<!-- Key point:

1. **Baseline way that models work:** (1) train a neural net to predict the next word given prior words; (2) generate new text by iteratively choosing the highest probability next word.

2. **This is a greedy suboptimal algorithm for generating a sequence.** One way of improving the fit of a sequence is "beam search", essentially you step ahead in the tree a couple of steps and choose the highest-probability sequence.

3. **I'm not sure how often lookahead is done in sequence generation.** I couldn't find any clear references on this.

4. **There are some genres of text where the greedy algorithm will likely perform very badly.** When there's something hidden in the text, e.g. a joke or a murder mystery. Humans often write these backwards: first the punchline then the setup, or first the murderer and then the clues.

   I should try to make some generalization about what the joint probability looks like for this type of text.

5. **Separate issue: generating the most likely completion will generate *likely* but *distinctive* output.** E.g. a story would always name a character "John Smith" and they live in New York and they have two children. It's the most likely outcome, but it's still very distinctive and would be highly diagnostic of being automatically generated.  This is independent of whether you're generating word-by-word or the whole sequence.

   People typically add some noise when generating text ("temperature") but it's not clear to me whether that is motivated by avoiding these highly-likely but distinctive patterns. -->

**[GPT4 training card](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf)**

> "GPT models are often trained in two stages. First, they are trained, using a large dataset of text from the Internet, to predict the next word. The models are then fine-tuned with additional data, using an algorithm called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to produce outputs that are preferred by human labelers.

**Wikipedia on GPT3:** *"The model was trained using generative pre-training; it is trained to predict what the next token is based on previous tokens."*

**Stephen Wolfram:** *"Now one thing I should explain about ChatGPT, that’s kind of shocking when you first hear about this. Is, those essays that it’s writing, it’s writing at one word at a time. As it writes each word it doesn’t have a global plan about what’s going to happen. It’s simply saying “what’s the best word to put down next based on what I’ve already written?"*"

**[Generation algorithms](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate).**

- Greedy search just generates the most likely next word.
- Says that greedy search "misses high probability words hidden behind a low probability word as can be seen in our sketch above:"
- **Beam search.** Do a 2-layer search. This would correctly choose the higher-probability completion in the "white dog" vs "black dog" scenario. "Beam search will always find an output sequence with higher probability than greedy search, but is not guaranteed to find the most likely output." I couldn't figure out whether GPT is greedy or uses beam search.

##             my question on FB

[FB post about greedy generation](https://www.facebook.com/tom.cunningham.374549/posts/pfbid02jAmXGWR2ZpAHadAmMPqcaunffuJoVrEsSRcemH3fUt65TxkKxsW3gpSj9KGWCqgEl). I talked about how (1) if choosing the most-likely next word then would be very bland; (2) intuitively would struggle generating things backwards.

I have a question for people who know something about language models (e.g. GPT).

In short: if LLMs are generating the most-likely next word, wouldn't that lead to characteristic differences from human writing?

I'm sure this must be discussed somewhere but I couldn't find the right keywords with Googling.

Some examples:

1. Wouldn't an LLM always make the details in a story be the most-likely details? E.g. characters would be called John Smith, who live in New York and have 2 children. Individually each detail is highly propbable but collectively they're highly improbable. (You could add noise with temperature>0 but then you sacrifice model fit presumably).

2. Wouldn't it be hard for for an LLM to write a detective story? Detective stories are typically written back-to-front: the writer decides the murderer then scatters the clues about. I would guess it's very hard to write a detective story front-to-back, you'd need an extraordinarily powerful LLM.

3. Wouldn't it be hard for an LLM to write a joke? E.g. a joke where there's something hidden in the setup then revealed in the punchline. 

4. A generalization of the above. A human can equally well write "the hash of A is B" and the "the reverse hash of B is A". But a sequential LLM could only ever write the first one.

I think the common observation tying these together is that maximizing the probability of a sequence isn't the same as maximizing the elements sequentially. I.e. suppose you choose words w1 and w2 to maximize P(w1,w2). That will not be the same as first choosing w1 to maximize P(w1) then w2 to maximize P(w2|w1).

#              Additional Notes


## 2023-04-16 |                      shallow and deep quality

**Q: how will generative AI affect communication?**

**Useful to distinguish between two types of quality: *shallow* and *deep*.** Shallow quality is something that can be immediately judged, deep quality depends on more thought or relation to other things.

   Shallow qualities: pleasing, tasty, amusing, refreshing. Could also say it's "self interpreting" or "self contained".

   Deep qualities: true.

   Other words: self-interpreting, self-contained. For deep: credence good.

**Generative AI is good for shallow qualities, but bad for deep qualities.**

|                      |         |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| memes                | shallow |
| captcha answer       |         |
| email/spam           |         |
| reddit comments      |         |
| short stories        |         |
| journal articles     |         |
| homework assignments |         |
| advertisements       |         |
| illustrations        |         |

**Observations:**

1. **User feedback is good for evaluating shallow quality, bad for evaluating deep quality.** User satisfaction is a good way of judging objects by qualities that can be immediately judged, e.g. food taste, movie entertaingness, music rhythm.However when the quality is deep then user satisfaction can be a poor guide: e.g.newspaper articles (you don't know whether it's true when you rate it), doctor (you don't know whether it's effective when you rate it).

2. **Shallow qualities are only *locally* shallow.** You can map out someone's immediate responses to movies, music, food, literature. But those responses are themselves functions of prior exposure. Not sure what this implies.

3. **Shallow quality is informationally insensitive, like a liquid asset.** Deep quality is like equity: less liquid than debt.

- Like liquid and illiquid assets - latter go through boom and bust ; crisis of liquid assets ; 

##             Others

**LLM ability bounded by the convex hull of human abilities.** 
   
   The Pareto frontier of what LLMs can do is bounded by the *convex hull* of what can be done by people in their training set.

   I.e. compared to any individual person an LLM can do a lot more things, but if there's nobody in the world can do some task then an LLM cannot do that task.

   (one semi-exception: an LLM can do a set of tasks much faster than any individual human, so an LLM can do any difficult task that can be decomposed into a set of simpler tasks, which is not generally true for humans)

**Submitting generated content.** Submitting reddit comments, submissions to literary magazines, letters to the editor, scientific papers to ARXIV.

   It used to be that you could tell from a skim that a certain amount of effort went in (could plagiarize but has some cost).
   
   New equilibrium perhaps you have to pay money to submit anywhere.


**Are artefacts under-determined or over-determined.**

- *MNIST image: over-determined:* If you have half an MNIST image .

- *under-determined:*

**Eliezer Yudkowsky on whether GPT would exceed human intelligence.** 2023-04-09 he made some tweets about how next-word-prediction requires *superhuman* intelligence, unlike GANs which try to predict a draw from the whole distribution. / His examples: (1) a sequence (hash,text); (2) a sequence (product,prime1,prime2). / These are sequences that are trivial to generate but very hard to do left-to-right. 

Not sure whether this is true. Distinction between being able to generate (A,B), vs able to generate B and A|B. 


**Yann LeCunn: argues that AI models needs sensory input for meaning and understanding.**

[Do large language models need sensory grounding for meaning and understanding?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BU5bV3X5w65DwSMapKcsr0ZvrMRU_Nbi/view)

1. ML models need much more input than humans or animals.

2. Self-supervised learning has taken over the world.

3. Failures of autoregressive large language models: 
   > "Performance is amazing ... but ... they make stupid mistakes Factual errors, logical errors, inconsistency, limited reasoning, toxicity... LLMs have no knowledge of the underlying reality They have no common sense & they can’t plan their answer"

4. "Auto-Regressive LLMs are doomed. They cannot be made factual, non-toxic, etc." Because probability of error accumulates at each step ( [tweet](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1640122342570336267?s=20) )

5. Deep problem: AR-LLMS "Have a constant number of computational steps between input and output. Weak representational power. Do not really reason. Do not really plan"

*Recommendations: Abandon generative models in favor joint-embedding architectures.*

**Q: suppose writing is *intentionally* bad, will an LLM be able to extract meaning?**

A lot of academic writing seems intentionally obscure. Classic case: you have a small true statement, but it's dressed up in big words so it's easy to get the impression that it's major. (castle/keep; motte/bailey)

(see discussion of Pinker on political science writing.)

**Can't ask about GPT's beliefs or understanding.** People ask whether GPT knows its limitations: this isn't a well-formed question, GPT is a next-word predictor, if it has beliefs those beliefs vary with the prompt. The beliefs of chatGPT could be a bit more consistent but they're whatever are the latent beliefs of a bland FAQ-style voice.

**When generating you typically want the *most likely* completion, not a *representative* completion.**

   Temperature=0 means generate the *most likely* next token.

   If we're using the model to answer questions we want the *most likely* outcome. Suppose we want GPT to tell us a fact or to generate code, and the model internally generates 3 answers: A with 60%, B with 35%, C with 5%. Then I think we want the model to always choose A. It would be a real pain if it returned the 5% probability answer 1/20 times.

   It partly depends on the source of the uncertainty, there are two sources: (1) model uncertainty; (2) intrinsic stochasticity in the world. E.g. given a phrase, what's the next word? It could be that, in the world, this phrase is *always* followed by a certain word, but the model hasn't had enough training data to figure that out. Or it could be that this phrase is followed by a distribution of other words.

   Cases where you'd prefer temperature>0: when you want the model to generate *multiple* outputs and you're going to choose among them.

   Q: are there cases where you're generating a single output and want temperature>0? I can't think of one.

**There's probably lots of latent structure that humans haven't discovered.**

   Advances in human knowledge have been more about organizing existing knowledge, than about discovering new knowledge. And computers seem to be very good at organizing existing knowledge and discovering latent structure. 

   E.g. Arisotle/Jigsaw: that the moon goes around the earth, earth around the sun, sun around the stars. That animals act to survive, and humans are a type of monkey. That gravity pushes everything down, energy is preserved, momentum preserved. The rules of logic and of calculus. Bayesian inference.

**What else might we find?** Relationship between diet and health; patterns in human history.

**Models trained on human creations will retain the human stain.** If models are trained on human artefacts which reference the world then anything they learn about the world will retain the failures of humanity. E.g. if they're trained on human paintings they'll learn to paint shadows in the shitty way that humans paint shadows.

   A computer will *prefer* an imperfect solution to a problem because a perfect solution wouldn't fit the data.

**Deep question: if models are trained on human performance, will they be able to outperform humans?** If humans have some ceiling of performance, can computers go above that ceiling?

**The hard things are easy: computers will make *better* art than humans.** Many of the achievements of artists are in making artefacts which satisfy many different criteria simultaneously, e.g.:

- Making a poem that rhymes and scans but also means something important.
- Making a music .

**LLMs imply much of written communication is redundant.**

   People often say they're using LLMs to generate a lot of text from a small prompt, e.g. writing emails, articles, academic papers, grant proposals, computer code. This implies the informational content of this text is much smaller than the text used.

   - For written communication perhaps implies that all organization tend to puff up their communication more than necessary.

   - For computer code perhaps implies that we could be designing more efficient computer languages.

**The weaknesses of LLMs are actually its strengths.** Many of the examples of GPT weaknesses are where it hallucinates/confabulates given some incorrect starting text. But we can evaluate the completion by two metrics: (1) whether it's true; (2) whether it's the most-likely completion given the starting text.

**On synthesis.** [Someone tweeted:](https://twitter.com/RichardSocher/status/1648735187088601088)

   > "GenAI is amazing when it would take a long time to create an artifact but very little time to  verify its correctness."

**Where LLMs will perform well vs badly.**

   It's all hitting us from a very unexpected angle. Our previous experiences with new technologies unfold very differently. We can make generalizations about culture and science and technology, but this is cutting things from an entirely different angle.

   *I think it won't work where there's a subtext.*

   In many parts of life the discourse is treacle: product of two forces -- weak and strong. If ML just learns to reproduce the ordinary *surface* forms then it won't learn how things work.

   Expect to be good at these:

   1. *Good at computer programming.*
   2. *Good at uncontroversial factual stuff.* -- the dates of celebrity marriages, tax rates.

   Expect to be bad at these:

   1. *Bad at answering a simple question from scientific literature.* E.g. answering how strong is the evidence for saturated fat and cholesterol. The literature is written using indirect phrasing -- the surface writing is non-sequiturs and inconsistent (cargo cult)(such as classical p-values) -- those who are conversant with norms can reason well about the underlying truth, but what's put into language is very partial.

   2. *Bad at discussing Egyptian civilization and interpretation of ambiguous evidence.* 

   3. *Bad at stating the price elasticity of tobacco consumption.* It won't be able to think about the short-run and long-run elasticities in an intelligent way and see through the opacities of how people write about these things.

**Captcha technology will get much worse.** Pictures with traffic lights.

  Analysis: core of good-faith actors, diluted by bad-faith actors (spammers , trolls, partisans), leads to decline in community.

**History of individual creation.** every nightclub an orchestra, every home a piano, every town a portrait painter, a wood carver , a tailor and seamstress , packs of stonemasons // as cost of ornament declined: short-run ornament everywhere, long-run ornament disappeared : // Victorian living room and Victorian public building w plaster and tin ornament everywhere , bauhaus made sick.

**Hairdressers and tattoo artists are the holdouts for mechanical reproduction.** They're the people who are still doing creative work in small communities.

**Nominal reality in media** -- tabloids celebrities , Hollywood star magazines , wrestling , soap operas and romance novels ; celebrity drama as staple of demand for media, "I love mess."

**ChatGPT is just reminding us of things we already know.** Will says he asks GPT to write a pitch for work, and he can compare it to his own pitch to see what he'd forgotten. ChatGPT doesn't have any more knowledge than he does, but it's more accessible. Will has to go fishing in his memory and hope he catches the big fish; alternatively he can use chatGPT to just drain the entire lake.


##             artefacts that are under-determined and over-determined

**Can define redundancy in two ways:**

  1. If you remove some data, how well can you reconstruct removed data?
  2. If you remove some data, how well can you reconstruct the latent factors?

**Examples of over-determined/redundant.**

  *Redundancy in letterforms:* If you slice off either the bottom half or the top half of a line of printed text then you can still read it. Partly because of redundancy in letterform, partly because of redundancy in spelling. (Put another way: if you had uniform priors over shape of letters, or over the spelling of words, then you wouldn't be able to predict).

  *Redundancy in words:* If you jumble the letters within each word in a sentence it's still pretty easy to read. Because both (1) letters in a word are not uniform, (2) words in a sentence are not uniform.

  *Redundancy in communication:* Most long documents can be summarized down to something short.

  *Redundancy in photos:* If you occlude half of the pixels in a photo you can usually reconstruct pretty well. 

**Examples of under-determined.**

  - *Infer reflectance from luminance.* You see luminance, but you know it's a product of reflectance and illumination, & you can only separate out those two with conjectures.

  - *Infer 3D image from 2D.* Given a 2D image there are infinitely many 3D configurations which that could represent.

  - *Bistable stimuli.* An image is consistent with either of two latent configurations (Necker cube, blue-gold dress). A sound can be consistent with either of two words being read.

  - *Ambiguous phrases.* You can construct a text so that it has two quite-different but consistent interpretations. E.g. in a comedy of misunderstanding you have a series of phrases which perpetuate the double meaning.

  - *Meaning of words (lasso).* A noun can refer to many different entities, and a sentence can mean many different propositions. We infer the meaning from context plus cooperative principle.

**Observations.**

1. **All perception is under-determined.** You see only a projection, you need to infer the higher-dimensioned reality. Only possible with some priors over reality.

2. **Reality is sparse.** 

3. **Sparsity implies redundancy.** The space of all possible artefacts is sparse (contains clusters), and so implies redundancy: (1) if you observe one property can infer the other properties; (2) if you encounter unusual combination of properties then agglomerate it to the nearest cluster.

4. **Most human artefacts are redundant.** If you add noise or you remove some data, you don't hurt interpretation much: letterforms, words spelling, word pronunciation, written communication.

5. **Redundancy implies interpretation will survive noise.** If you add some noise it doesn't matter.

**Model.**

##             academic literature focuses on "compositionality"

- Compositionality means basically that it respects logical relationships independent of the semantics.
- Raphael Milliere and Gary Marcus [2023 conference on AI and compositionality](https://compositionalintelligence.github.io/#references)

## 2022-10-01 |                      Synthetic Content and Twitter

**Computers are getting very good at synthesizing new content.**

**Implications for twitter:** As a Twitter employee we're like a fisherman seeing a fish farm being built, or a cowboy driving past a factory for making synthetic meat.

**Synthetic entertainment.** People spend probably 3 hours/day consuming entertainment on average. It's not obvious why we couldn't synthesize that entertainment.

**Decentralized information sources tend to have more misleading information.** We can divide information sources into centralized (TV, newspaper, website, verified twitter accounts) and decentralized (email, social media posts, reshares, retweets). In democracies decentralized information sources typically have a much higher fraction of misleading information, though of course they have bits and pieces of truth, and in non-democracies they can have a lot.

**Most misinformation is in text, not audio or video.**

1. It's like a fisherman seeing a fish farm. Cattle rancher driving past a synthetic meat plant.
2. People come to our zoo to see the animals, but we see someone working on animatronic animals.
3. We should triple headcount on chain of trust —- decentralization does not help (chain of custody)
4. Personal connection and verifiability is valuable but still substitutable —- watching people you don't know on TikTok, TV and Netflix can still absorb a lot of your attention.

###       LLMs could cause substantial improvements in our classifiers

My impression is that the new large-language models (LLMs) are routinely beating specialized models at their own benchmarks.

This implies we could see substantial improvements in our classifiers, e.g. it seems plausible we could have dramatic improvements in predicting whether a tweet is toxic, etc. It seems likely that these models could do better than human raters. We might be able to get rid of paid raters *entirely* and instead just feed the LLM a small "golden set." (For a decade Zuckerberg has been promising that AI would dramatically lower the burden on human raters and I always thought it was hot air, but now I believe it).

The new models might also get far better at predicting the quality of a tweet, which could lead to big increases in ranking quality.

###       LLMs could synthesize new content

**Right now** GPT3 can already produce moderately funny tweets (!), at the cost of about 0.2 cents/tweet.[1]

This could dramatically change the economics of all media, and Twitter might be the first in the firing line because text is the easiest thing to generate (though images are getting pretty close).

It seems to me likely that over the next few years a lot of passive media consumption will be replaced by AI-generated content: sitcoms, Instagram, TikTok, ads. An algorithm will be able to generate highly engaging content tailored to anybody.

Even if the average synthetic tweet is only moderately funny, it's easy to run them through a filter of humans (or other ML models) to find the most entertaining. So I think it's likely **already** possible to generate an enormous volume of entertaining content at extremely low price.

One vague feeling is that, if synthetic content becomes indistinguishable from organic content, then perhaps it'll become relatively more important to have a *chain of trust* or *verification*. That people will be particularly sensitive to verified authorities, because there's no other way of telling whether something is legitimate or not. (I guess people freaked out about deepfakes a few years ago, and nothing much has happened since then. I have a feeling that these new models are going to be more disruptive but I should try to think that feeling through more.)

[1]: OpenAI charges 6c/1000 tokens for using their best model (DaVinci v2). They say 1000 tokens is roughly 4000 characters or 750 words. If 20 words/tweet then 0.2c/tweet.

##              old summary

**Unlike humans, computers are equally good at recognizing and synthesizing.** Humans can recognize whether an object satisfies some property but we struggle to synthesize a new object with that property. We can recognize whether a joke is funny, a melody is pretty, or a drawing looks like a cat. It's much harder to write a funny joke, compose a pretty melody, or make a drawing that looks like a cat. This asymmetry is because much of our knowledge is pre-conscious (AKA encapsulated): it can be used to recognize things but it's hard to use that knowledge for other purposes.

   However computers have comparable ability to both recognize *and* synthesize. In recognition computers are approaching human-level ability, e.g. transcribing speech, identifying objects in photos, labeling text. However unlike humans their ability to synthesize has grown in proportion to their ability to recognize. They can synthesize speech, create photos with identifable objects, create text that satisfies some property.

**Synthesis could immediately replace much human labor.** Illustrators, designers, copywriters, musicians. 

**Synthesis could replace a lot of entertainment.** People spend around 6 hours every day consuming entertainment: TV, Netflix, YouTube, Tik Tok, Twitter.  It seems likely that computers will soon be able to produce reasonable-quality substitutes for these at essentially zero price.

**Synthesis will make fakes harder to detect.** It will become harder to discriminate between spam and non-spam emails, between plagiarized and original text, and between forged and genuine manuscripts.

**Synthesis will disrupt communication and make provenance more important.** A lot of communication between people relies on being able to discriminate between real and fake. If computers can generate content that's indistinguishable from the real thing then it'll become relatively more important to check the provenance of everything we see or read.

**Synthesis may make people value creative work less.** When technology makes something easier to create then it often loses its value.

**Synthetic gemstones haven't destroyed market for natural gemstones.** We have figured out how to make synthetic rubies, pearls, diamonds. They haven't destroyed prices for natural gemstones.

   Diamonds are somewhat more difficult than other gemstones: (1) still labour-intensive to grow synthetic diamonds, especially large ones; (2) labour-intensive to cut them: you can only cut diamonds with other diamonds, delicate process.

   > "Synthetic rubies, cultured pearls, synthetic spinel, and synthetic alexandrite are examples where the products from the labs are superb and are available for a fraction of the cost of their natural counterparts. ... prices do occasionally plummet because of it. It’s happened before with other industries, but it HASN’T happened with gems. People who want an awesome 3-carat natural Kashmir sapphire simply don’t consider the lab stones to be an acceptable alternative no matter how pretty they are."

**Discovery of prompting.** The first GPT paper in 2018 trains a likelihood model over text and then tries using it to solve various standard benchmarks, mainly by comparing likelihood of different sentences. Only in one application do they augment the initial input: when doing sentiment analysis they compare likelihood of "is very positive" and "is very negative."

   RLHF works well because it is easier (for humans) to discriminate than to generate. Simple example: it's much easier to spot a good haiku than it is to generate one.

   RLHF models lose some entropy ... that means that they give more peakky results. Base model will give lots of diverse outputs.

   > "Prompting is just making up for the cognitive differences between these two architectures: our brains and LLM brains"

   E.g (1) chain-of-thought: (2) self-consistency - ensemble of multiple attempts; (3)  ask for reflection - ask whether it thinks it answered the question;  (4) tree of thought -- maintain multiple completions and prune them. 

   > "A lot of these steps are consistent with recreating our System 2"

   > "LLMs don't want to succeed, they want to imitate. You want to succeed and you should ask for it.

   Transformers will learn both low-quality and high-quality solutions. Best token: "Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer." Say "you are a leading expert."

   Future: combine memory-only (LLM) with retrieval-only (Google). 

   Constrained prompting: force outputs to be in a certain template, e.g. JSON.

   Fine tuning: LoRa clamps most of the parameters. RLHF is very difficult to implement.

   - Says transformers provably can't learn context-free grammars.
   - Says transformers can't learn recursive algorithms. Appearance otherwise is them just learning local things.

**Knowledge and intelligence are *substitutes* in logical domains.** For playing chess, solving maths problems, proving theorems, then you can do very well with just copying previous written literature and extrapolating.

   Will you hit a ceiling when you get to the frontier? 

**Observation: AI models can shuffle content and style, but can't so easily operate on content.** A clear achivement of machine learning models is that they can separate out the *meaning* and the *style* of artefects, e.g. they can translate a sentence from one language to another, or from prose to poetry, etc.. They can change the style of a picture: impressionist, etc.. / However it's not clear that they can do substantial maniplations *within* the semantic content.
