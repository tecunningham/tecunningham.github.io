**ARGUMENT**

   1. _AI will shrink the types of communication that are "self validating"_

      A messages is "self validating" if the existence of the message is strong evidence for some claim, even without knowing where the message came from. Text is not generally self-validating because it's trivial to make up, however a photo can be self-validating.

   2. _Most communication is not self-validating_

      Most of the claims we come across in daily life we find persuasive because of the source, not the mere existence of the message. If you found the same message on 4chan, in a fortune cookie, in a text from your brother-in-law when he was drunk, you wouldn't update so much.

**APPLICATIONS**

   _fake announcement by government_   -- safd

   _fake announcement by celebrity_    -- 

   _fake leak from government_         -- more plausible than fake leaks.

   _fake message from friend_          -- 

   _fake recipe_

**TERMS**

- provenance
- self-interpreting
- self-validating
- watermarked
- cryptographic watermark
- digitally signed

**ANALOGIES**

- *anti-forgery measures in letters*: watermarked paper, signature, fingerprint, using a code, signature on the envelope over the seal, sealing wax.
- *anti-forgery measures in documents*: watermark, UV light, hologram, filigree.
- *codes.* 


**MISC.**

- _Prior to 1850 no messages were self-validating_ Since the mid 19th century we've invented photography, audio recording & video. These messages are often strong evidence, in themselves, of some claim (people say "photographic proof", "the camera never lies"). Before 1850 communication was with speech, writing, and drawings, none of which is self-validating in this sense.

- _"the camera never lies"_ -- phrase from 1880s, used when people complained that their photos didn't look like them. The first documented usage of the phrase in print was someone saying that it's false, i.e. the camera *does* lie obviously.

- _bad guys have two strategies:_ (1) compromise the channel of communication; (2) create fakes. In general you need to do both, they're complements.


**PREDICTION BY TYPE.**

**Commercial spam.**
  - _Examples_: "cheap raybans", "new coin"
  - _Current vector_: auto-posting through (1) bot accounts, (2) compromised accounts.
  - _Prediction_: decline in recognizable spam to close to zero.

**Phishing.** Tries to get user to take an action that will compromise their computer, e.g. "click to open attachment from Microsoft."
   - Often worded to .

**Catfishing.**
   - _Examples:_ "hi what's your name" from a pretty stranger.
   - 

- Fake anonymous stories (e.g. on r/AMA, r/extrans, etc.)
