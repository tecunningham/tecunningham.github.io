        "Assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Each person chooses some design $x$.** They get payoff $y(x)$, but the function $y(.)$ is unknown, so you don't observe the payoff until you try it out. You can interpret the action as a blueprint for a house, a business plan, a computer program, an agricultural practice, a novel, a song. Everything below also applies when the payoff depends on the state, $v(x|z)$, and so the action is context-specific, e.g. replying to an email, operating a car, operating a machine, writing copy to advertise some product.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **You keep making the same choice over time.**\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Everyone is playing an independent game, but can observe each other.** We're all subsistence farmers living side-by-side, our actions don't directly affect each other. Suppose we can all observe each others' choices but not their payoffs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Exploration will decrease over time.**With a single agent they will stop exploring at some point, and choose $x$ every period. E.g. we see that societies adopt certain practices in agriculture, architecture, clothes, cooking, and then settle on those once they have exhausted local improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Everyone will do the same thing (herding).** If actions are observable then it is rational for each person to imitate others' actions, and so within a society everyone's actions will tend to be clustered in a neighborhood (if you're walking through a minefield, you want to follow someone else's footsteps).[^Aumann] \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **There will be inefficiently little exploration.** When you try out a new $x$ then your neighbors benefit because they can learn from your experience. We will thus have a million farmers all doing the same thing, it would be better if some of them experimented. We can collectively organize this: (A) sponsor people to run experiments; (B) let people register a claim on some $x$ and charge others to use it (intellectual property protection).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Bigger societies will find better designs.** Bigger societies will have (A) more random variation to learn from; (B) more ability to collectively organize to explore.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **People will become experts.** Some people will learn the local neighbhorhood of their payoff-space and can charge for that expertise: artisans, architects, artists, doctors.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "[^Aumann]: Define equilibrium as when everyone chooses the same $x$ every period. This follows if there's common priors, common-knowledge-of-rationality, and a regularity assumption on beliefs. Choosing some $\\cap{x}$ implies that, for every $x\\neq\\cap{x}$, that $E[y(\\cap{x})] - E[y(x)]\\geq 0$. Assume these inequalities are always strict, meaning every $E[y(x)]$ is one-to-one (injective). Then if two people choose different $x$ they must disagree about one of those inequalities, violating common knowledge of rationality (Aumann's agreeing-to-disagree).\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Agricultural Yield is Exploration.** Agricultural societies slowly accumulated crop management practices that have raised yields (irrigation, rotation, fertilizers). The invention of printing made knowledge diffuse more quickly, & so more people caught up to the knowledge frontier (e.g. Diderot's encyclopedia). Organized research advanced the frontier. People argue over whether intellectual property was a positive or negative for innovation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Technologies of Reproduction.** You could extend the model such that you pay a lower cost when your action is an exact copy of an existing action (a reproduction). Certain technologies made it cheap to reproduce existing things: writing, printing, photography, audio recording, video recording. This increases welfare but makes outcomes more homogenous, the distribution of actions becomes very spikey.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Science Maps out the Landscape.** Normal progress consists of mapping out individual points on the landscape. Scientific progress is different - it maps out big areas. Newtonian mechanics tells you the stability of any bridge; modern chemistry tells you the properties of any combination of ingredients.\n",
        "\n",
        "##          Applications to AI\n",
        "\n",
        "There are multiple things AI can do here: (1) predict the outcome given each context and action ($v(\\bm{z},\\bm{x})$); (2) find an action $\\bm{x}$ which maximizes $v(\\bm{z},\\bm{x})$; (3) predict the typical human action ($\\bm{x}$) given the context ($\\bm{z}$). The last is imitative.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Human-level classification (content moderation, radiologists).** You train a model on human labels to classify inputs. Now classification becomes very cheap. Expect this to be a substitute for low-skilled employees: borderline cases would still be escalated to the high-skilled employees.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **Super-human classification (sexing chickens; MRI).** You see a chick $z$, you choose whether to raise it to a chicken ($x\\in\\{0,1\\}$), and you get payoff if the chicken is female. Humans can't tell the difference between male and female chicks by sight, but suppose AI models figure out how to do it. This is a pure yield increase for chicken ranchers because you save the cost of raising male chicks.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Synthesize media (text, music, video, ads).** Here the function $v(\\cdot)$ represents human appreciation. Thus the function is known in a certain sense but the knowledge is implicit, and so in practice we explore the space and we we have experts: writers, musicians, artists, who can create content that gets a good reaction.\n",
