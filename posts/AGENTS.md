## Overview

This repo hosts the source for a personal website/blog. It includes post sources
(`.qmd`, `.md`, `.typ`, `.tex`), bibliographies (`.bib`), figures/images, and
some generated artifacts (HTML/PDF and `_cache`/`_files` outputs).

## Bibliography notes

`ai.bib` is partly machine-updated. It contains documentation at the top of the
file describing BibTeX formatting guidelines.

## Conventions

- Files named `XXX.llm.qmd` indicate documents written by an LLM.
