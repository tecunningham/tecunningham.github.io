I've collected forecasts of AI's effect on growth over 2025-2035.
: The full list of forecasts is in a table below. I'm not distinguishing between forecasts of growth in GDP, TFP, labor productivity, or welfare; I'm also mixing forecasts for the US, EU, and World. Some forecasts aren't explicitly over a 10 year horizon but I hope I'm not being unfair. Please send me an email if I'm misinterpreting one of these.

Economists say 0.1--1.5%.
: The two exceptions are @baily2023machines and @korinek2024scenarios. Most forecasts by economists assume that AI is a one-time technology shock which is slowly adopted, while these two papers (both with Anton Korinek as coauthor) assume that AI will continue to progress. Further discussion below.

AI people say 3--30%.
: Forecasts by people involved in AI are between 3% and 30%, with the exception of Andrej Karpathy, who says he expects GDP growth to remain on historical trends.

      There are also some forecasts by AI-involved people which do not mention GDP because they expect dramatic things to happen, e.g. human extinction or post-scarcity, such that GDP is no longer relevant.

Forecasting markets expect modest impacts.
: Forecasting markets appear to expect relatively flat economic variables over the next 10 years. As of October 2025, Metaculus shows expectations over the next century:

      - [World productivity growth increases smoothly from 3% to 5%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/12663/cagr-gdp-growth-per-capita/).
      - [Labor force participation falls smoothly from 84% to 36%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/18289/) 
      
      The changes are large but it takes 100 years, and the transition is relatively smooth. The smoothness is consistent with either (1) shared expectations of smooth growth; (2) shared expectations of discontinuous changes but uncertainty about when; (3) shared expectations of discontinuous growth but disagreement about when (i.e. disagreement between forecasters).
       
Financial markets expect modest impacts.
: Asset prices do not seem to anticipate dramatic effects from an intelligence explosion, though they are hard to interpret. @chow2024transformative argues that if the markets expect AGI then real interest rates should go very high, for two reasons: (1) if people expect dramatically higher incomes today they will save less and spend more (pushing interest rates up); (2) the returns on AI investments will be very high (pushing interest rates up).

#           Observations

It seems odd to expect high capabilities growth but small economic growth.
: Tyler Cowen & Andrej Karpathy both predict that AGI is imminent, but also that economic growth will not move by more than 0.5%/year. They give a variety of reasons for expecting limited growth effects, some are static (low substitutability), some are dynamic (slow diffusion, complementary innovation). However I  but I would love to understand the quantitative importance of these factors.

      Suppose it takes 20 years to fully diffuse, and each year we experience 0.5% incremental growth, then the equilibrium impact of human-level intelligence will be a 10% increase in output. It's hard for me to imagine human-level AI would only increase output by 10% in equilibrium, when we've already increased output/capita by more than 1000% over the last 100 years.  A prediction that an effectively unlimited supply of cognitive labor (i.e. AGI) would cause an 0.5% annual growth seems to imply either extraordinarily low substitutability or extraordinarily slow diffusion.


<!-- inventing AGI would be 10X smaller than industrial revolution, or catch-up growth in East Asia, or post-war European growth ; find episodes of highest economic growth -->

Many economic forecasts assume AI will stop getting better.
: It is worth emphasizing that many forecasts of AI's impact assume that AI is a one-time change which will slowly diffuse through the economy, i.e. they assume that (1) AI will not get any better than it is today, and (2) AI will not help with productivity growth, e.g. through improving R&D.

      I believe this is true of most forecasts below, including @acemoglu2024simple and @aghion2024ai, however @baily2023machines separately discusses the impact on the long-run growth rate.

      I don't feel these papers put in sufficient work to justify the assumption that AI is a one-time shock. The capabilities of AI have been growing tremendously over the past few years, why should we assume that this growth will stop?


The impact in 2024 was perhaps ≈0.5%.
: We can estimate in a few ways:
      
      - @bick2025rapid estimate that in late 2024, 1-5% of US working hours are on chatbots. With a variety of assumptions about time saved they get aggregate productivity of 1.1%.^["Between 1 and 5% of all work hours are currently assisted by generative AI, and respondents report time savings equivalent to 1.4% of total work hours. ... implies a potential productivity gain of 1.1%."]
      - @collis2025welfare ask chatbot users what they would need to be paid to forego using the app for a month, and the average answer is $100. Multiplying this by 80M users they estimate the total consumer value of chatbots is $97B, which is 0.3% of a $30T US GDP.
      - @humlum2025large finds chatbot users self-report approximately 3% productivity improvement, but there's no detectable impact on wages or employment.

AI may increase welfare without increasing GDP.

: AI is already providing a great deal of value (there are 800M weekly ChatGPT users), but the value mostly won't show up in GDP by our normal accounting methods. In fact it's plausible that AI reduces GDP because it reduces demand for expertise: I no longer call my garage-door-repair guy, because ChatGPT tells me how to fix the door. Services are generally accounted for in GDP just by the wages paid to service-providers. If people substitute from human service-providers towards AI then measured GDP will fall even though true output has increased. If service-providing firms pass through their cost-savings to customers then their measured contribution to GDP will fall. The same argument applies to much older technologies -- the printing press, the encylopedia, YouTube. I don't believe any of the papers below consider this effect.

: @filippucci2024miracle has a useful table that compares assumptions on productivity impacts across four forecasts.

Comparison of cross-task productivity boosts.
: @trammell2025workflows has a useful diagram showing the assumptions on labor-savings from three different models. The shaded areas represent the potential time-savings due to AI, all are based on @eloundou2023gpts's classification of O*NET tasks, but the other two papers apply haircuts.
