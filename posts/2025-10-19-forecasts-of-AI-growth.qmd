I've collected forecasts of AI's effect on economic growth over 2025-2035.
: The full list of forecasts is in a table below. Some of the forecasts are of growth in GDP, some GWP (gross world product), some TFP, some labor productivity. I'm also mixing forecasts for the US, EU, and World. Some forecasts aren't explicitly over 2025-2035, but most are roughly that range. Please send me an email if you think I'm misinterpreting one of these.

Economists and AI people disagree.
: 1. **Most economists' forecasts are 0.1--1.5%/year.** The two exceptions are @baily2023machines and @korinek2024scenarios.
      1. **Most AI insiders' forecasts are 3--30%/year.** A notable exception is Andrej Karpathy who recently says he expects GDP growth to remain on historical trends.[^gate]

[^gate]: I classified Epoch's GATE model (@erdil2025gate) as by "AI people", though the authors are a mixture of academic economists and people who work in AI.

The disagreement is about the AI, not about the economics.
: The primary reason for the disagreement seems to be about the future rate of AI capabilities progress, not about the more directly economic questions such as (1) the current economic impact of AI; (2) the rate of diffusion & adoption over time; (3) the substitutability between AI-produced and human-produced services.

      Many of the forecasts by economists effectively assume no further progress in AI, which I think is striking.
      
      There is a small economics literature on the long-run equilibrium effects of AGI (@aghion2019artificial, @restrepo2025missed), but those papers do not make quantitative forecasts about growth rates over the next decade.

More observations below.
: Below this table I discuss:

      1. Most economists are treating AI as a one-time shock.
      2. It seems hard to reconcile imminent AGI with modest growth.
      3. The impact of AI on output in 2024 was perhaps ≈0.5%.
      4. AI will likely increase welfare more than GDP.
      5. Forecasting markets seem to expect slow impacts.
      6. Financial markets seem to expect modest impacts.

#           Observations

Most economists are treating AI as a one-time shock.
: The table below from @filippucci2024miracle compares assumptions across four recent papers which have forecast the future economic impact of AI. There are two notable things about this table:

      1. The assumptions are static: each of the rows estimates the economic impact of *existing* AI by referring to studies of cost savings from using LLMs.
      2. The papers all exclude any effect of AI effect on "innovation" (the bottom row).
: ![](images/2025-10-10-08-14-31.png)

    This seems to me striking. It is possible that AI capabilities will stop growing, but it is not at all clear that this should be our primary forecast, given the speed in capabilities growth over the last few years (see my [earlier post](https://tecunningham.github.io/posts/2025-09-19-transformative-AI-notes.html) for some evidence).[^gpts]

    [^gpts]: It seems to me quite plausible that these papers over-estimate the productivity impact of existing LLMs: (1) the AB tests showing productivity improvements are on unrepresentatively self-contained tasks and are likely distorted by publication selection; (2) the @eloundou2023gpts estimates of very large time-savings from GPT-4 are based just on intuitions.


It seems hard to reconcile imminent AGI with low economic growth.
: Tyler Cowen & Andrej Karpathy both seem to expect that (1) AGI is imminent, but also (2) economic growth will not shift dramatically from its historical trend. I find these hard to reconcile.

      Cowen says OpenAI's o3 is "already AGI", though also says AGI is difficult to define, and he says he expects 0.5% excess growth/year. Karpathy says he expects AGI (defined as a drop-in worker) in ten years, but also that there will be no change to the historical trend in economic growth. They give a variety of reasons for expecting limited growth effects: some are static (low substitutability between AI-produced and human-produced goods), some are dynamic (slow diffusion, complementary innovation, slow accumulation of compute capital).

      I find it hard to quantitatively reconcile imminent AGI with a low growth rate. Suppose it takes 20 years for the technology to mostly diffuse, and each year we experience 0.5% incremental growth, this implies the *equilibrium* impact of human-level intelligence will be a 10% increase in output.[^comin]
      
      It's hard to see how human-level AI would only increase output by only 10%. Suppose there was *zero* ability to substitute between AI-produced goods and human-produced goods, this would imply the increase in output would be equivalent to the share of goods that AI could produce. Thus a 10% growth would imply we can automate 10% of production with AI (assuming costs of AI are negligible relative to existing labor and capital costs).
      
      High growth rates are not unprecedented. Over 100 years Western countries increased output/capita by more than 10 times, and China was able to achieve that growth over 25 years.

      It seems to me Cowen and Karpathy's predictions require assuming either (1) AGI only allows for automation of a relatively small share of labor (i.e. it's not very general); (2) diffusion of AGI will be slower than historical precedents.

   [^comin]: @comin2014technologydiffusion say "the average adoption lag across all technologies (and countries) is 44 years," but since the 1950s it has been 7-18 years.


<!-- inventing AGI would be 10X smaller than industrial revolution, or catch-up growth in East Asia, or post-war European growth ; find episodes of highest economic growth -->


The impact of AI on output in 2024 was perhaps ≈0.5%.
: We can estimate the economic impact of AI on output a few ways:
      
      - Total LLM revenue in 2024 was probably below $10B (0.03% of GDP), but the benefits produced are likely far higher.
      - @bick2025rapid estimates that in late 2024, 1-5% of US working hours are on chatbots. With a variety of assumptions about time saved they get an aggregate productivity increase of 1.1%.^["Between 1 and 5% of all work hours are currently assisted by generative AI, and respondents report time savings equivalent to 1.4% of total work hours. ... implies a potential productivity gain of 1.1%."]
      - @collis2025welfare asks American chatbot users what they would need to be paid to forego using the app for a month, and the average answer is $100. Multiplying this by 80M users they estimate the total consumer value of chatbots is $97B, which is 0.3% of a $30T US GDP.
      - @humlum2025large finds Danish chatbot users self-report approximately 3% productivity improvement (the same paper also finds no detectable impact on wages or employment).
   
      I do not consider the effect of AI investment on output (e.g. building chips and datacenters) -- that is a qualitatively different effect because it depends on *expectations* of future value of AI, not the contemporary effects.


AI will likely increase welfare more than it increases GDP.

: AI is already providing a great deal of value that will not show up in GDP by our normal accounting methods. My own paper with OpenAI (@chatterji2025chatgpt) shows that 2/3 of the use of ChatGPT is outside of work.

      In fact it's plausible that AI will somewhat reduce GDP, because it reduces demand for expertise: I no longer call my garage-door-repair guy, because ChatGPT tells me how to fix the door. Services are generally accounted for in GDP just by the wages paid to service-providers. If people substitute from human service-providers towards AI then measured GDP will fall even though true output has increased. If service-providing firms pass through their cost-savings to customers then their measured contribution to GDP will fall.

      I believe all of the papers in the table below consider only the effect on measured GDP, not on welfare.



Forecasting markets seem to expect slow impacts on growth.
: The best forecasting markets I could find were on Metaculus, however note that both of these were relatively sparse, and have some internal discrepancies. They expect relatively flat economic variables over the next 10 years. As of October 2025, Metaculus shows expectations over the next century:

      - [World productivity growth increases smoothly from 3% to 5%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/12663/cagr-gdp-growth-per-capita/).
      - [US Labor force participation falls smoothly from 84% to 36%](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/18289/) 
      
      The changes are large but it takes 100 years, and the transition is relatively smooth. The smoothness is consistent with either (1) shared expectations of smooth growth; (2) shared expectations of discontinuous changes but uncertainty about when; (3) shared expectations of discontinuous growth but disagreement about when (i.e. disagreement between forecasters).
       
Financial markets expect modest impacts.
: Financial market valuations of AI companies imply they expect the flow of AI-related earnings from existing companies to be perhaps around 2% of GDP. This is very large, but is consistent with either (1) AI companies capture a large share of a modest change to growth; or (2) AI companies capture a small share of a large change to growth.[^gdp] 

      @chow2024transformative argues that if the markets expect AGI then real interest rates should go very high, for two reasons: (1) if people expect dramatically higher incomes today they will save less and spend more (pushing interest rates up); (2) the returns on AI investments will be very high (pushing interest rates up).

[^gdp]: Suppose the total valuation of AI-related companies is $10T, which is perhaps around 10% of all capital stock. Using P/E of 15, a $10T valuation implies a stream of $600B in earnings/year, which is 2% of GDP.
