[^krugman]: "history suggests that large economic effects from A.I. will take longer to materialize than many people currently seem to expect ... ChatGPT and whatever follows are probably an economic story for the 2030s, not for the next few years."
[^gans]: "I don’t think it will boost growth appreciably ... over the next 10 years"
[^karpathy]: Dwarkesh: "Just to clarify, you’re saying that the rate of growth will not change." ... Karpathy: "Yes, my expectation is that it stays in the same pattern."
