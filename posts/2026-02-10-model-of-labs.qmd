All figures are **annualized run-rates as of end-2025**, not full-year totals. This is an **operating-expense view** — it excludes capital investment (data-center buildout, GPU purchases, etc.), which OpenAI currently accesses via cloud contracts rather than owning outright. Large one-off training runs are treated as annualized steady-state spending; in practice they are lumpy and might more properly be amortized over the useful life of the resulting model.

Confidence: 🟢 = reported/leaked figure, 🟡 = triangulated from partial data, 🔴 = rough guess.

| Line item | Estimate | | Source / justification |
|:---|---:|:---:|:---|
| **Revenue** (ARR) | **\$20B/yr** | 🟢 | CFO statement, late 2025 ([Reuters][1]). Consistent with H1 revenue of \$4.3B growing to \$13B full-year target ([The Information][6]) |
| | | | |
| **Pretraining** | | | |
| &ensp; R&D staff & overhead | \$3B/yr | 🟡 | ~4,000 employees ([WSJ][7]); H1 R&D was \$6.7B incl. compute ([The Information][6]); \$3B is residual after subtracting compute items below |
| &ensp; Experimental compute (exploratory runs) | \$3B/yr | 🟡 | In 2024, ~\$5B R&D compute, mostly experiments not final training ([Epoch AI][3]); scaled up for 2025 |
| &ensp; Frontier pretraining compute | \$4B/yr | 🟡 | Residual so pretraining subtotal = \$11B; consistent with Epoch AI and Fortune magnitudes ([Fortune][5], [Epoch AI][3]) |
| &ensp; Data acquisition & storage | \$1B/yr | 🟡 | Known deals: News Corp \$250M/5yr, Reddit \$60M, plus AP, FT, Axel Springer ([Reuters][8]); total licensing likely \$200–300M/yr; remainder is scraping, curation, storage |
| ***Pretraining subtotal*** | ***\$11B/yr*** | | *Sum of above* |
| | | | |
| **Post-training** | | | |
| &ensp; Post-training R&D (algorithms, tooling) | \$1B/yr | 🔴 | No public breakdown; no leaked figures on post-training sub-costs |
| &ensp; Post-training compute (SFT, RLHF, evals) | \$2B/yr | 🔴 | No direct disclosure; assumed large but smaller than pretraining compute |
| &ensp; Post-training data (labeling, preference) | \$1B/yr | 🔴 | No public number; consistent with scale of human + synthetic feedback pipelines |
| ***Post-training subtotal*** | ***\$4B/yr*** | | *Sum of above* |
| | | | |
| **Inference / serving** | **\$13B/yr** | 🟡 | \$8.65B Azure payments in first 9 months ([TechCrunch][2]); \$13B extrapolates end-2025 run-rate. *Caveat:* compute margin reached ~70% by Oct 2025 ([CoinCodex][9]), implying lower unit cost; \$13B may overstate Q4 run-rate |
| **Other opex** (S&M, G&A, rev-share, etc.) | \$7B/yr | 🟡 | H1 S&M alone was \$2B ([The Information][6]) → ~\$5B/yr run-rate; plus G&A, legal, compliance, 20% Microsoft rev-share (~\$4B on \$20B). Total plausibly \$7–9B |
| | | | |
| ***Total costs*** | ***\$35B/yr*** | | *11 + 4 + 13 + 7. Cross-check: Fortune reports \$22B full-year spending vs \$13B sales ([Fortune][5]); run-rate > in-period average because costs ramped through the year* |
| ***Revenue − costs*** | ***–\$15B/yr*** | | *Consistent with projected \$9B net loss for 2025 ([Fortune][5]) scaling to higher end-of-year run-rate* |
